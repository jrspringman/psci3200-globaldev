    General questions about the course, materials, or assignments should be posted to the course Slack. For other issues (absences, etc), feel free to email me or send me a direct message on Slack. I will attempt to respond to these messages within 25 hours, but life can be busy and chaotic for everyone, so if I don't respond right away, don't worry!
