# R and RStudio

## Resources

- This activity draws on Chapter 1 in [Statistical Inference via Data Science: A ModernDive into R and the Tidyverse](https://moderndive.com/1-getting-started.html)


## What are R and RStudio?

- In the quantitative methods tutorial, we will use R and RStudio to illustrate basic statistical concepts
- R is a programming language and free computing environment for statistical computing and graphics
- RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that provides an interface by adding many convenient features and tools
- Think of R as a car's engine and RStudio as the dashboard

R is a programming language and free computing environment for statistical computing and graphics. It can be runs on a wide variety of operating systems, including Linux, Windows, and MacOS. RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that provides an interface by adding many convenient features and tools.

You can think of R as a car's engine and RStudio as the dashboard. In the same way that having access to a speedometer and a navigation system makes driving much easier, using RStudio’s interface makes using R much easier as well.

R and RStudio are entirely free and updated on a regular basis, making them much more accessible and widely used than paid alternatives. You can conduct nearly any analysis using R, ranging from calculating the average of a variable to creating maps and conducting spatial analysis to conducting the analysis for an impact evaluation.
