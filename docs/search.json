This course will allow students to engage with cutting-edge research that deploys new data and contemporary social science research methods to understand development, as well as hands-on experience analyzing diverse types of data. The course will be organized around several timely substantive topics in global development, including democratic backsliding and autocratization, political accountability and citizen engagement, climate change resilience, and migration. As we explore these topics, students will be introduced to data analysis methods, inferential techniques, and computational tools that are useful across a wide range of applications. Specifically, students will deepen their understanding of basic statistical methods common to the social sciences (such as linear regression), learn how these methods can be used to make inferences about population characteristics and causal relationships, and prepare documents that contain reproducible data analysis workflows using markdown.\nThis class is also designed as a follow-up to PSCI 1102. Students are encouraged but not required to take that course before this one. Students should be ready to engage with data assignments in the programming language R. This means that students should also have taken PSCI 1800 or an equivalent course. Students that have not taken PSCI 1102 and PSCI 1800 (or an equivalent) should contact the instructor before enrolling. Students more comfortable in Python are welcome, but will receive less instructor support."

This involves two broad skill sets: (1) learning the computing and programming tools to both manage and analyze data; and (2) understanding the conceptual foundations of why we might manage or analyze data in one way versus another. This course will address both of these topics.\nSpecifically, at the end of the course you should be able to:\n\nSummarize and visualize data\nWrangle messy data into tidy forms\nEvaluate claims about causality\nBe able to use linear regression to analyze data\nUnderstand uncertainty in data analysis and how to quantify it\nUse professional tools for data analysis such as R, RStudio, git, and GitHub\n\nWe will also attempt to inspire a passion for data analysis and create a community among the students to deepen their learning.\n\nExpectations\nIn this course, you will be expected to\n\ncomplete eight problem sets,\ncomplete eight weekly tutorials,\ntake two take-home, open-book exams, and\nwrite one final data analysis project.\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nYou should already have R and RStudio installed\nWe will also use git and Github to manage our projects.\nThis class is also designed as a follow-up to PSCI 1102.

That could be public opinion in U.S. elections, United Nations voting patterns, patterns of racial discrimination in police behavior, the distribution of salaries in basketball, or the economics of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. No matter the topic, you will formula a key research question, find data on that question, answer the question using the tools of the course, and present those results for public consumption.\nThe goal is for this to be a professional project that you can use to showcase the skills that you have gained to potential employers. Your final submission will be a publicly available article/website that contains: (1) a brief introduction to the research question and data collected; (2) a visualization of the data in question that speaks to your research question; (3) a presentation (as a table or graph) of a regression model assessing your question along with a plain-English interpretation; (4) a brief (one-paragraph) section that describes limitations of your analysis and threats to inference, and states how your analysis could be improved (e.g., improved data that would be useful to collect). Finally, there must be a link to the GitHub repo that contains the source code to load, clean, and analyze the data and produce the article.\nThe data collection and cleaning must be meaningful—it’s not sufficient to simply use a pre-cleaned data from an R package. Self-collected data is allowed and even encouraged, though beware that it can only be used for the final project itself only unless you go through human subjects approval from the University.\n\n\n\nMilestone\nDue Date\n\n\n\n\nCreating a GitHub Repository\nFri, Sep 29th 11:59pm ET\n\n\nData and Proposal\nFri, Oct 13th 11:59pm ET\n\n\nFirst Visualization\nFri, Nov 3rd 11:59pm ET\n\n\nFirst Analysis\nFri, Nov 17th 11:59pm ET\n\n\nFinal Report\nWed, Dec 13th 11:59pm ET"

Accommodations do not alter fundamental requirements of the course and are not retroactive. Students should request accommodations as early as possible, since they may take time to implement.
