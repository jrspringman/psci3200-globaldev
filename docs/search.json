    "text": "Course Description and Objectives\nRecent years have seen a tremendous growth in the amount of data available and our ability to process it. This raises the exciting possibility that these advances can be used to improve governance and benefit the world’s poor. In this course, students will engage with cutting-edge research that deploys new data and contemporary social science research methods and gain hands-on experience analyzing diverse types of data using rigorous research designs and broadly useful computational tools.\nThe course will be organized around several timely substantive topics in global development, including democratic backsliding and autocratization, citizen engagement, crime and corruption, and climate change and migration. As we explore these topics, students will gain a deeper understanding of the challenges that shape governance and development outcomes and ways that contemporary social science and the development ‘industry’ seeks to address them.\nAt the same time, students will be introduced to data analysis methods, inferential techniques, and computational tools that are useful across a wide range of applications. Specifically, students will deepen their understanding of basic statistical methods common to the social sciences, learn how these methods can be used to make inferences about population characteristics and causal relationships, and prepare documents that contain reproducible data analysis workflows.\nAt the end of the course you should be able to:\n\nEvaluate the quality of evidence in the development field\nThink clearly about how data can be used to learn about development and governance challenges\nUse tools for data analysis such as R, RStudio, Quarto, and GitHub\nProduce professional-quality documents that summarize original research\n\nI hope that this course will encourage both passion and measured optimism about the potential for contemporary social science tools to address complex problems affecting governance and development in less developed countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\n\nThis class is designed as a follow-up to PSCI 1102. Students that have not taken PSCI 1102 and PSCI 1800 (or an equivalent) should contact the instructor before enrolling."

    "text": "Course Materials\nThis course relies primarily on free, open-source materials. However, the purchase of one textbook will be required. All other reading materials will be uploaded to this website or circulated on Slack at least one week before the meeting.\n\nBooks\nStudents are required to purchase a copy of Data Analysis for Social Science: A Friendly and Practical Introduction (DSS). We will use DSS as a jumping-off point for this course. While students are expected to already be familiar with many of the tools and concepts covered by this book, it will serve as a method to review core concepts and orient discussion about how to expand on these skills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired book\n\n\n\nI am asking students to purchase a copy of DSS because it comes with access to additional, helpful resources. If you are unable to purchase this book, you must let me know. To save money, consider e-renting the textbook.\n\n\n\n\nComputing\nIn the course, we will be using R for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. R is free, open source statistical computing environment available on all major operating systems. We will also be using RStudio, a free, widely used graphical interface for R. For document preparation, we will be using Quarto, a free, open-source scientific and technical publishing system that is compatible with both R/RStudio and Python, as well as several other languages. Both Quarto and RStudio are supported by a company called Posit. For version control, we will be using Github.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired software\n\n\n\nStudents are expected to already have R and RStudio installed on the personal computer that they will be using for class. We will cover the installation of all other required computing tools during the course.\n\n\nSeveral course requirements will require you to write and submit R code. Your code must be appropriately commented and reproducible. To ensure your code meets the course standards, please follow this style guide from Hadley Wickham (Chief Scientist at Posit and developer of ggplot2 and tidyverse)."

    "section": "Course Structure",
    "text": "Course Structure\nSubstantively, the course is divided into several parts. Part 1 presents a general introduction to the course and a brief introduction to correlation, causality and statistical inference. The remaining parts are structured around key substantive topics in development. For each topic, we will begin with a brief overview of the literature. Then, we will focus on one particular research question and use it as a guide to learn how to implement some of the most common research designs in the social sciences. Throughout, you will gain hands-on experience with diverse kinds of data through in-class workshops and data assignments. Weekly reading assignments will be divided between contemporary research on substantive topics in global development and textbook chapters focused on social science research methods. You are expected to attend class and be prepared to engage in discussion about the assigned readings.\n\n\nGrading\nPerformance in this class will be evaluated by according to performance on the following course requirements:\n\n\n\nRequirement\nPercent of Final Grade\n\n\n\n\nQuizzes (4)\n10%\n\n\nWorkshops (4)\n10%\n\n\nData Assignments (3)\n36%\n\n\nFinal Project (1)\n44%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBump-up policy\n\n\n\nI reserve the right to “bump up” the grades of students who have made valuable contributions to the course, including participation in lectures or workshops or helping other students by answering questions on Slack. This also applies to students who show tremendous progress over the semester.\n\n\n\n\nRequirement Descriptions\nThere are four graded requirements for this course.\nQuizzes\n\nYou are expected to attend each course meeting. On four randomly selected meetings, there will be a brief quiz designed to test whether or not students did the readings. Students with a pre-approved absence will be required to take the quiz remotely within 24 hours of its administration (in the event your absence falls on a quiz date). Students will be permitted one pre-approved absence for the semester.\nGrade: 10%\n\nWorkshops\n\nWe will have four workshops throughout the semester. These will be interactive, hands-on workshops allowing students to gain familiarity with new statistical methods or computational tools. These workshops will cover important tools, such as quarto and github, and data analysis tasks, including cleaning, visualization, and modeling. After each workshop, you will be required to submit a product (ex. the link to a git repo, a quarto doc, an R script, etc.) demonstrating completion of the workshop.\nGrade: 10%\n\nData Assignments\n\nThere will be three data assignments throughout the semester. These assignments are designed to give you an opportunity to apply tools and methods discussed in readings, lectures, and workshops to data from the real world. Where possible, we will use data collected by DevLab@Penn researchers. These are individual assignments. While I encourage you to collaborate with your colleagues as you think through the tasks, you will be required to submit your own code and write-up.\nGrade: 36%\n\n\n\n\nData Assignment\nDue Date\n\n\n\n\nAssignment 1\nMar 28th 11:59pm ET\n\n\nAssignment 2\nApr 11th 11:59pm ET\n\n\nAssignment 3\nApr 30th 11:59pm ET\n\n\n\nFinal Project\n\nThe final project is a data analysis project that will use data of your choosing. The only stipulation is that this data must be relevant to one of the global development topics covered in this course. The assignment will require you to formulate a research question, find data that can help you answer that question, apply the tools and methods from this course to the data you have selected to answer your research question, and present those results for public consumption.\nThe goal will be to produce a professional project that can showcase the skills that you have gained to potential employers. Your final submission will be a publicly available webpage that contains: (1) a brief introduction to your research question and data; (2) a discussion of your research design, its assumptions, and threats to inference; (3) a visualization that describes your data; (4) a presentation of the results from a regression model (as a table or graph) and discussion of its implications for your research question; and (5) a discussion of the implications of your findings for development policy or practice, including the limitations of your analysis and suggestions for future research. In addition to the public-facing webpage, you must share access to a GitHub repo that contains the code to reproduce the project output.\nGrade: 44%\n\n\n\n\nMilestone\nDue Date\n\n\n\n\nCreate a GitHub repository\nFeb 8th 11:59pm ET\n\n\nIdea for research question and data source\nMar 12th 11:59pm ET\n\n\nSubmit proposal (research question and design)\nApr 11th 11:59pm ET\n\n\nSubmit final project (webpage url and repo)\nMay 10th 11:59pm ET"

    "text": "Course Policies\nPlease review these course policies carefully. Any questions or concerns about these policies should be raised during the first week of class.\n\nLate Submissions and Regrading\nLate submission of assignments will incur a penalty of 2 points for every day late, except in documented cases of serious illness or family emergency. If you feel there has been an error in the grading of one your assignment, you may request in writing a regrade of the assignment. First, I will request a detailed write-up of your dispute. Second, I will regrade the entire assignment, not just the part you are disputing. Therefore, your regrade might increase or decrease the overall grade on the assignment.\n\n\nUse of AI Tools\nYou are welcome to use generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, to assist you with your work in this course. There is mounting evidence from rigorous research that these tools increase human productivity. I believe that their use will continue to proliferate, so it is important to gain experience integrating them into professional tasks. However, AI tools frequently make errors and ‘hallucinate’ information about things that do not exist (journal articles, R functions, etc.). It is your responsibility to verify the information provided by such tools. Most importantly, you are required to disclose your use of AI tools for assignments in the form of footnotes or citations. The use of AI tools will not be counted against you. On the contrary, I want to adopt and share your clever or innovative applications of AI tools.\n\n\nElectronic Devices\nLaptops will be required in class. All other electronic devices should be silenced and hidden. If there is an emergency situation and your phone must be visible, please inform me at the beginning of class. Please don’t make me come up with consequences for violating this policy.\n\n\nControversial Topics and Statements\nIn our exploration of global development, we will strive to maintain an inclusive learning environment. I believe that respect for diverse perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds is essential for effective development research and practice. If you feel that statements made during class (by other students or by me) have undermined this, please contact me directly so that we can address the issue.\nThis course may deal with subject-matter that is difficult or controversial. It is crucial to approach these topics with sensitivity and openness. Students are required to treat one another with respect, even in cases of disagreement. At times, research findings may be in-tension with your normative commitments. I urge students to engage earnestly and critically with any evidence that challenges your prior beliefs.\n\n\nAcademic Honesty\nStudents are expected to follow the University of Pennsylvania’s Code of Academic Integrity. Suspected violations will be referred to university administration for disciplinary action. If you have any doubts or questions about what constitutes academic misconduct, please do not hesitate to contact me."

These resources are available for a reason, and students should feel comfortable taking full advantage of them. I am not an expert in accessing these resources, but I will be happy to help you secure support that will help you succeed at Penn.\n\nMental Health\nYour mental health is important to me. Struggles with mental health, as well as serious mental illnesses, are common across students, faculty, and staff. Please feel free to reach out to me about issues you are having within or outside of this course. I emphatically encourage anyone who thinks they may benefit to utilize the university resources listed below:\n\nCounseling and Mental Health Services\n24/7 Services: 215-746-9355\n\nPlease note that this list is not comprehensive. If there are services that you think should be added to this list, please let me know.\n\n\nAccessibility\nAccessibility is a shared value and a shared responsibility at Penn. The Weingarten Center partners with other departments throughout campus to coordinate and improve the accessibility of buildings and grounds, transportation, communication, and digital infrastructure. Students that require academic accommodations should contact the Weingarten Center. Academic accommodations are determined on an individualized basis through an interactive process that involves student self-disclosure, documentation of disability, and an initial meeting with a Disability Specialist. Accommodations do not alter fundamental requirements of the course and are not retroactive. Students should request accommodations as early as possible, since they may take time to implement. Students can notify the Weingarten Center at any time during the semester if adjustments to their communicated accommodation plan are needed."

It is difficult to learn without comparison. For example, an article that identifies 10 habits of successful people might seek to provide guidance on what behaviors you can adopt to become more successful. However, we should also ask how common these behaviors are among people who are not successful. Similarly, an evaluation might point out that 70% of organizations that participated in a capacity-building intervention reported an improvement in their capacity over the course of the intervention. But we should also ask whether these improvements were larger than improvements experienced by similar organizations that didn’t participate. Correlation is the fundamental tool that allows us to answer these important questions.\n\n\n\n\nWhat do we need to calculate correlations?\n\nMeasures of central tendency\n\nMean\nProportion\n\nMeasures of spread\n\nVariance\nStandard deviation\n\n\n\nIn order to calculate correlations, we need to begin with quantities that we want to compare across groups. For example, we might want to calculate the mean, or the average, of a certain variable. We also need to measure how much variation, or spread, there is in these measures. Are the units in our sample very similar, or are their values spread our across a wide range?\n\n\n\n\n\\mu_X = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i}^{n} X_i\n\nmy_vector = rnorm(10, mean = 10, sd = 5)\n# Step 1: Sum the values\nsum_values &lt;- sum(my_vector)\n# Step 2: Count the number of elements\ncount_elements &lt;- length(my_vector)\n# Step 3: Calculate the mean\nmean_value &lt;- sum_values / count_elements\n\nprint(mean_value)\n\n[1] 9.499699\n\nmean(my_vector)\n\n[1] 9.499699\n\n\n\nWe begin by reviewing some basic statistical concepts and illustrating those concepts using R code. This will build your familiarity with R while providing a quick review of basic statistical concepts. Everyone knows how to calculate the mean of a variable. In R, there are multiple ways to do it. Here, I created a random variable with 10 values and an average value of 10. You can calculate the mean by hand or using the function ‘mean()’. Both approaches should give you the same value.\n\n\n\n\n\\sigma^2_X = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i}^{N} (X_i - \\mu_X)^2\n\n\nWhat does the square in \\sigma^2 accomplish?\nWhat are the implications for interpretation?\n\nUnits\nDistribution\n\nEven with these basic measures, we’re already thinking about the distribution!\n\n\n\nYou’re also probably familiar with variance. Variance measures how spread out the values of a variable are around the mean. For the variance of X, we take the sum of the squared differences between each value of X and the mean value of X, and then divide by the number of observations. While squaring the differences is necessary to avoid positive and negative values cancelling out one another, it poses challenges for interpretation. Most importantly, the variance is not on the scale of the variable, so there is no intuitive way to interpret its value. The squaring of the differences also means that more weight is put on observations that are very far from the mean value. The next few slides illustrates this with simulated data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a vector\n## Create vector, sort by size, and store var\nset.seed(123)\ndat = rnorm(10, mean = 10, sd = 5)\ndat = sort(dat)\no_var = var(dat)\nprint(dat)\n\n\n [1]  3.674694  6.565736  7.197622  7.771690  8.849113 10.352542 10.646439\n [8] 12.304581 17.793542 18.575325\n\n\n\nFirst, we create a vector of simulated data with a known mean and standard deviation. In statistics and computer science, a vector is a one-dimensional array, which is a data structure that stores elements of the same type in an ordered sequence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a constant to a big number\n## Create new dataframe for big addition and store vector length\nb_dat = dat\nind = length(b_dat)\n\n## Add four to the largest number in the vector and calculate size of var increase\nb_dat[ind] = b_dat[ind] + 4\nb_var = var(b_dat)\nval = b_var - o_var\ncat(\"Variance increases by\", val )\n\n\nVariance increases by 8.890842\n\n\n\nSecond, we add 4 to the largest value of X and observe the change in the standard deviation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a constant to a smaller number\n## Create new dataframe for small addition\ns_dat = dat\n\n## Add four to the smallest number in the vector and calculate size of var increase\ns_dat[ind-2] = s_dat[ind-2] + 4\ns_var = var(s_dat)\nval = s_var - o_var\ncat(\"Variance increases by\", val )\n\n\nVariance increases by 3.316847\n\n\n\nFinally, we add 4 to the smallest value of X and observe that the change in the standard deviation is much smaller. Again, this is because squaring the differences places more weight on extreme values very far from the mean\n\n\n\n\n\\sigma_X = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i}^{N} (X_i - \\mu_X)^2}\n\n\nWhat does the \\sqrt{} accomplish?\nWhat are the implications for interpretation?\n\nExpressed in the same units as the observations\nHow far we expect each observation to be from the mean, on average\n\nIt is often desirable to report effect sizes as SDs\n\n\n\nAnother measure of spread is the standard deviation. The standard deviation is just the square-root of the variance, and tells us the average absolute difference between values of X and the mean of X. By taking the square root of the variance, we convert it back to the original units of the data, making it a more interpretable measure of dispersion. For example, if the data represents weights in kilograms, the standard deviation will also be in kilograms. A larger standard deviation indicates that the data points are more spread out from the mean, and a smaller standard deviation indicates that they are closer to the mean. In many research contexts, especially in the social sciences and medicine, it’s common to report effect sizes relative to the standard deviation. This is because it provides a scale of variability that can be used to compare the magnitude of an effect across different studies or different units of measurement. For example, an effect size of 0.2 standard deviations is often considered a small effect, regardless of the actual units of the data.\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out this interactive visualization\n\nObserve how changes in the standard deviation affect the shape of the distribution\n\n\n\nIn a new tab, open this interactive visualization of how changes in the standard deviation affect the shape of the distribution. Follow the instructions to see what increases in the spead of a variable looks like.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCovariance \\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i}^{N} (X_i - \\bar{X})(Y_i - \\bar{Y})\n\nProduct of the deviations\nRange: unbounded\n\nCorrelation coefficient \\text{Cor}(X, Y) = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(X, Y)}{\\sigma_X \\sigma_Y}\n\nCovariance normalized by product of SDs\nRange: -1 to 1\n\n\n\n\nNow that we have reviewed the fundamental components of correlation, we can turn to the three primary ways of measuring correlation. Correlations rely on two variables, typically denoted as X and Y.\nCovariance measures the joint variability of two variables. As you can see from the equation, the covariance is calculated by summing the product of the deviations of X and Y and dividing this value by the number of observations. Deviations are calculated by taking each value of X and Y and subtracting the variable’s mean value. Covariance can tell us if increases in one variable generally correspond to increases in another (positive covariance), or if increases in one correspond to decreases in the other (negative covariance). However, the scale of the covariance is not standardized, making it difficult to interpret. , In fact, the results are unbounded, meaning that there is no minimum or maximum value for covariance.\nNext, we turn to the correlation coefficient, which normalizes the covariance by the product of the variables’ standard deviations, forcing them to take a bounded range that can tell us the strength and direction of correlation. The Correlation Coefficient tells us the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. A correlation of 1 means there is a perfect positive linear relationship, -1 means there is a perfect negative linear relationship, and 0 implies no linear relationship at all.\nIn summary, while covariance provides a first glance at the direction of a relationship, the correlation coefficient helps us understand both the strength and direction in a standardized format, making it easier to interpret and compare across different studies or datasets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculate covariance\nset.seed(1234)\n# Generate two vectors of 10 random numbers each from a normal distribution\nx &lt;- rnorm(10, mean = 10, sd = 5)\ny &lt;- rnorm(10, mean = 10, sd = 5)\n# Calculate the means of both vectors\nmean_x &lt;- mean(x)\nmean_y &lt;- mean(y)\n# Calculate the covariance between the two vectors\ncovariance &lt;- sum((x - mean_x) * (y - mean_y)) / (length(x) - 1)\ncov(x,y)\n\n\n[1] -4.657457\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculate correlation\n# Calculate the standard deviations of both vectors\nsd_x &lt;- sd(x)\nsd_y &lt;- sd(y)\n\n# Calculate the correlation coefficient between the two vectors\ncorrelation &lt;- covariance / (sd_x * sd_y)\ncor(x,y)\n\n\n[1] -0.1752832\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlope \\beta_X = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(X, Y)}{\\sigma^2_X}\n\nCovariance normalized by variance\nExpected change in Y with 1-unit change in X\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we can calculate the slope of a regression line, which normalized the covariance by the variance and tells us the expected change in Y when we observe a 1-unit increase in X. Here, “normalized” refers to the process of dividing the covariance of X and Y by the variance of X. Normalization refers to the process of scaling a variable so that it fits a specific scale. In this case, normalizing the covariance by the variance of X allows us to interpret the size of the slope in terms of the expect change in Y associated with a 1-unit increase in X.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculate slope\n# Calculate the variance of X\n# Variance = sum((X_i - mean_X)^2) / (n - 1)\nvariance_x &lt;- sum((x - mean_x)^2) / (length(x) - 1)\n\n# Calculate the slope (beta) of Y on X\n# Beta_X = Cov(X, Y) / Var(X)\nbeta_x &lt;- covariance / variance_x\nlm(y ~ x)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = y ~ x)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)            x  \n    10.9280      -0.1879  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does the correlation coefficient tell you that slope doesn’t?\n\nConsistency of the relationship on bounded scale (-1 to 1)\n\nWhat does slope tell you that the correlation coefficient doesn’t?\n\nSubstantive importance (magnitude)\n\nGive an example of when you’d prefer each\n\nCorrelation: When comparing relationships on different scales\nSlope: When thinking about ROI\n\n\n\n\nHere’s a quick review of the concepts we just covered.\n\n\n\n\nWhat can with do with them?\n\nDescription: quantitative comparisons\nForecasting: sample population \\rightarrow out-of-sample\nCausal inference: correlation + research design\n\nSimple, but powerful\n\nNon-linearities, interactions, machine learning\n\n\nThese simple but powerful statistical tools perform much of the work in contemporary quantitative social science research, ranging from simple description, to forecasting, to causal inference. These simple linear correlation can be combined with squared terms to estimate non-linear relationships, iterations to estimate how a relationship between two variables is affected by values of other variables, or powerful research designs to make inferences about causal relationships.\n\n\n\n\nY_i = \\alpha + \\beta X_i + \\epsilon_i\n\n\n\nWhat is \\alpha?\nWhat is \\beta?\nWhat is X_i?\nWhat is \\epsilon_i?\n\n\n\n\nLinear regression models are often referred to as the “workhorse of the social sciences”. Whether it’s estimating difference in political opinions across demographic groups or calculating the causal effect of a randomized intervention, most analyses rely on linear regression. The most frequently used model is called “Ordinary Least Squares”. The most simple models consisten of an intercept (alpha), which estimates the average value of Y when the independent variable is at 0, the slope or coefficient (beta) for X, which captures the relationship between X and Y (the independent and dependent variables), and the error term (epsion) which captures the variance in Y that is not explained by the intercept and beta.\n\n\n\n\nEstimating model parameters\n\\hat{Y_i} = \\hat{\\alpha} + \\hat{\\beta} X_i\nCoefficient\n\\hat{\\beta} = \\Delta{\\hat{Y}} / \\Delta{X}\n\nLinear regression provides you with parameter estimates with which you can calculate the expected value of Y by adding together the terms on the right-hand-side of the equals sign in the model.\n\n\n\n\nWhat are residuals\n\\hat{\\epsilon_i} = Y_i - \\hat{Y_i}\nHow do we minimize them?\nSSR = \\sum_{i}^{N} \\hat{\\epsilon}_i^2\n\nOrdinary least squares works by estimating parameter values the minimize the residuals of the model, which are the difference between each value of Y and the value predicted by the model based on the model parameters. As with our measures of variance, this is done using the sum of squared residuals, to avoid positive and negative differences from cancelling out.\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out this interactive visualization\n\nSee how the least squares method is used to calculate the slope of the line by drawing a line that minimizes squared errors\n\nCheck out this interactive visualization\n\nSee how changes in the intercept and slope represents negative and positive relationships across different distributions of Y\n\n\n\n\n\nY_i = \\alpha + \\beta_1 X_{i1} + \\beta_2 X_{i2} + \\epsilon_i\n\n\nHow does our interpretation of \\alpha change?\nHow does our interpretation of \\beta_1 change?\n\n\n\nMultiple regression works very similarly to simple linear regression, although interpretation becomes slightly more complicated. The intercept (alpha) is not the mean of Y when both independent variables (X1 and X2) are held at 0, while the value of B1 now captures the relationship between X1 and Y while X2 is held constant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple Regression\n# Load required libraries\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.1.2\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n\nMultiple Regression\nlibrary(modelsummary)\n\n# Set seed for reproducibility of random numbers\nset.seed(123)\n\n# Create a data frame with 100 observations\ndata &lt;- data.frame(\n  X1 = rnorm(100, mean = 10, sd = 2),    # Generate 100 random numbers for the first independent variable\n  X2 = rnorm(100, mean = 5, sd = 2),     # Generate 100 random numbers for the second independent variable\n  Y = rnorm(100, mean = 10, sd = 2)      # Generate 100 random numbers for the dependent variable\n)\n\n# Introduce correlation between X1 and Y\ndata$Y &lt;- 0.5 * data$X1 + rnorm(100, mean = 10, sd = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple Regression\n# lm() function fits linear models\nsimple_model &lt;- lm(Y ~ X1, data = data)\n\n# Run multiple regression model (Y ~ X1 + X2)\nmultiple_model &lt;- lm(Y ~ X1 + X2, data = data)\n\n# modelsummary() function provides a summary of the regression models\nmodelsummary(\n  list(\n    \"Simple Linear Regression\" = simple_model,\n    \"Multiple Regression\" = multiple_model\n  ),\n  estimate = \"{estimate}{stars} ({std.error})\",\n  statistic = NULL,\n  gof_omit = 'IC|RMSE|Log|F|R2$|Std.',\n  output = \"dataframe\"\n)\n\n\n       part        term         statistic Simple Linear Regression\n1 estimates (Intercept) modelsummary_tmp1        10.219*** (0.594)\n2 estimates          X1 modelsummary_tmp1         0.475*** (0.057)\n3 estimates          X2 modelsummary_tmp1                         \n4       gof    Num.Obs.                                        100\n5       gof     R2 Adj.                                      0.405\n  Multiple Regression\n1   10.100*** (0.663)\n2    0.476*** (0.058)\n3       0.022 (0.055)\n4                 100\n5               0.400\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich of the following statements describe a correlation?\n\nMost professional data analysis took a statistics course in college.\nThe longer a person runs the more calories they burn.\nPeople who live to be 100 years old typically take vitamins.\nOlder people vote more than younger people."

It is difficult to learn without comparison. For example, an article that identifies 10 habits of successful people might seek to provide guidance on what behaviors you can adopt to become more successful. However, we should also ask how common these behaviors are among people who are not successful. Similarly, an evaluation might point out that 70% of organizations that participated in a capacity-building intervention reported an improvement in their capacity over the course of the intervention. But we should also ask whether these improvements were larger than improvements experienced by similar organizations that didn’t participate. Correlation is the fundamental tool that allows us to answer these important questions."

While squaring the differences is necessary to avoid positive and negative values cancelling out one another, it poses challenges for interpretation. Most importantly, the variance is not on the scale of the variable, so there is no intuitive way to interpret its value. The squaring of the differences also means that more weight is put on observations that are very far from the mean value. The next few slides illustrates this with simulated data."

For example, if the data represents weights in kilograms, the standard deviation will also be in kilograms. A larger standard deviation indicates that the data points are more spread out from the mean, and a smaller standard deviation indicates that they are closer to the mean. In many research contexts, especially in the social sciences and medicine, it’s common to report effect sizes relative to the standard deviation. This is because it provides a scale of variability that can be used to compare the magnitude of an effect across different studies or different units of measurement. For example, an effect size of 0.2 standard deviations is often considered a small effect, regardless of the actual units of the data."

Correlations rely on two variables, typically denoted as X and Y.\nCovariance measures the joint variability of two variables. As you can see from the equation, the covariance is calculated by summing the product of the deviations of X and Y and dividing this value by the number of observations. Deviations are calculated by taking each value of X and Y and subtracting the variable’s mean value. Covariance can tell us if increases in one variable generally correspond to increases in another (positive covariance), or if increases in one correspond to decreases in the other (negative covariance). However, the scale of the covariance is not standardized, making it difficult to interpret. , In fact, the results are unbounded, meaning that there is no minimum or maximum value for covariance.\nNext, we turn to the correlation coefficient, which normalizes the covariance by the product of the variables’ standard deviations, forcing them to take a bounded range that can tell us the strength and direction of correlation. The Correlation Coefficient tells us the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. A correlation of 1 means there is a perfect positive linear relationship, -1 means there is a perfect negative linear relationship, and 0 implies no linear relationship at all.\nIn summary, while covariance provides a first glance at the direction of a relationship, the correlation coefficient helps us understand both the strength and direction in a standardized format, making it easier to interpret and compare across different studies or datasets."

This is due to the “fundamental problem of causal inference”, which arises from our inability to observe counterfactuals. In causal inference, a counterfactual refers to the hypothetical outcome that would have occurred if a subject, who was exposed to a particular treatment or condition, had instead been exposed to a different treatment or no treatment at all. Counterfactuals are a fundamental concept in establishing causal relationships because they help to model what would have happened in an alternate scenario. We always think of causal relationships in terms of a counterfactual. Thinking about a causal relationship between a binary treatment variable D and an outcome Y, for any unit in our sample, we want to observe the value of Y in simultaneous worlds in which the unit does and does not receive the treatment D. For example, if we wanted to measure the effect of a malaria vaccine on the number of days a person misses work in a month, we want to observe simultaneous counterfactual worlds in which that person both does and does not receive the vaccine. Obviously, this is impossible. However, rigorous research designs allow us to estimate this relationship under certain conditions."

    "text": "Can’t we just observe and compare?\n\n\nIn the real world, differences in units’ exposure to X is often driven by important differences that also affect those units’ values of Y. This is called “confounding”. When confounding is present, our estimates of the causal effect of X on Y will be biased, potentially creating the illusion of a causal relationship that doesn’t actually exist. Consider this example, where the NYT reported on a study that found a correlation between opera attendance and longevity. Here, the journalists inferred that this correlation was causal, meaning that by changing whether or not someone goes to the opera, you can change how long they live. However, there are many factors that confound this relationship, including income, which is correlated with both opera attendance and lifespan."

This can lead to fundamentally wrong conclusions about the impact that certain policies or interventions will have. For example, this Tweet captures an individual arguing that large sample sizes (erroneously referred to as “numbers of n’s”) allow you to interpret correlations as causal. However, this is extremely incorrect. Larger samples are subject to the exact same sources of confounding as small samples. Thinking back to the previous slide, there are still systematic differences between people that go to the opera and those who don’t. No matter how large the sample size, it would be wrong to assume that giving out opera tickets will prolong people’s lives. Understanding the challenges of causal inference and being able to communicate these challenges to others can be a huge advantage for researchers that want to help others learn about the world."

Randomized experiments offer us a powerful tool because they allow us to rule-out bias confounding variables, providing a clearer picture of cause and effect relationships. This method is applied across a broad range of fields, and is the foundation for inference in many social and physical science disciplines. For instance, when conducting an impact evaluation, interventions are randomly assigned to different groups to assess their effects. This could be educational programs, economic policies, or health-related initiatives. In survey research, we often randomize exposure to specific images or text to understand how different types of content influence opinions or behaviors. This approach is particularly valuable in areas like marketing or political science, where the impact of media and messaging is critical. Clinical trials are also a form of randomized experiment that’s essential in pharmacology and medical research. Here, medical treatments are assigned randomly to participants to rigorously test their efficacy and safety. By employing randomized experiments, we can draw accurate conclusions about causality, significantly improving the ability of research to inform the design policies and interventions."

Firstly, impact evaluations can be extremely resource-intensive. They require substantial financial investment, extensive data collection, and deep technical expertise and implementation experience. This means that resources might be diverted away from other interventions and research. This can also make them impractical for smaller organizations or interventions with limited budgets. Another limitation is the generalizability of the results. What works well in one specific context or population might not necessarily be effective elsewhere. For this reason, it is necessary to include partners with deep contextual knowledge that can tailor interventions to the context. Relatedly, interventions that are extremely effective with a small group of people might be completely ineffective at a larger scale. Many evaluations have found that wildly successful interventions have no impact when moving from treating a very small proportion of the population to a larger proportion of the population or when moving from or from implementation by an NGO to implementation by a national government agency. Understanding these limitations and ethical considerations is crucial for conducting responsible and effective impact evaluations and for making responsible policy recommendations based on findings. From an ethical standpoint, impact evaluations have several unique features that must be considered. First, the status quo should be maintained for control groups. In other words, it is not acceptable to deny the control group access to something that they had before the evaluation period as part of the research. It is OK to withhold new benefits, but it is never OK to revoke or withdrawal existing benefits. Furthermore, there might be resistance from communities or organizations that feel threatened by the changes proposed through the intervention or are upset about how the treatment is being assigned. Finally, when using random assignment, it is important to consider the potential impact on vulnerable populations. Extra effort must often be made to ensure that random assignment does not accidentally exclude specific populations by virtue of their geographic location or differences in social integration. For example, when an intervention is randomly assigned at the village level, minority groups may be less likely to benefit if they are less socially integrated or actively excluded by local institutions. For more general discussion of ethics in research, including the role of ethical review boards, see the Overview for this module."

Because IEs are expensive, researchers often need to limit the number of subjects (whether they’re individuals, communities, or organizations) involved in an evaluation. Small sample sizes can reduce the statistical precision of our evaluation, and may result in an evaluation that is unable to distinguish a small impact from no impact. This severely limits our ability to learn from the research. Similarly, randomizing assignment among a small sample increases the risk that our treatment and control groups will be systematically different on pre-treatment characteristics, which can produce misleading results. Think back to the interactive visualization on the first slide of this tutorial.\nHowever, there are some advanced methods to reduce the risks associated with small sample sizes in randomized evaluations. However, all of these methods require researchers to have pre-treatment baseline data about the subjects among which assignment is being randomized.\nFirst, we have Re-randomization. This technique involves randomizing the treatment assignment multiple times and selecting the assignment that returns the best balance across assignment, as measured by baseline data on subject characteristics. It’s particularly useful when you’re working with a limited number of participants but still want to ensure a fair distribution of characteristics.\nNext is Blocking. In blocking, we group participants with similar characteristics together before randomly assigning treatments within these blocks. This method reduces variability between the groups, improving the efficiency and balance of our comparisons, which is crucial in studies with small sample sizes.\nWe also have Non-bipartite Matching. This approach matches participants in treatment and control groups based on similar characteristics, allowing for more flexibility and potentially better balance across a large range of pre-treatment characteristics. However, this method can be complex and computationally intensive.\nIt’s important to note that these methods—despite being quite sophisticated—primarily ensure balance on observed characteristics. This means they help us control for known variables, but there may still be unobserved variables that could influence the outcomes.\nIn summary, while these methods enhance the reliability of our results within the constraints of small sample sizes, they do not completely eliminate the limitations associated with unobserved factors. It’s essential to interpret results with an understanding of both the strengths and the limitations of these statistical techniques.”"

However, these tools require very precise conditions and can be difficult to implement without significant background in causal inference methods. For this reason, we provide a high-level overview so that researchers can seek-out more information on methods that seem relevant to their work.\nCausal inference with observational data (situations where researchers did not actively manipulate how the treatment was assigned) has been a rapidly growing area of research in the social sciences since the 1990s. There are several specific tools used in this field, each of which rely on specific conditions in the world, many of which are fare. For example, many researchers look for situations in the world that resemble experiments due to naturally occuring random assignment, such as lotteries or discontinuities in exposure, variation in exposure to treatment over time, or creating balance on observable characteristics through matching and weighting procedures. While these methods all have weaknesses, they are essential causal inference tools for social science research."

These designs ensure that the treatment and control groups are as similar as possible at baseline. By doing this, we aim to isolate the variable of interest and measure its true effect on the outcome. However, it’s important to recognize that these strategies are not foolproof.

It’s crucial, however, to ensure that the assumptions behind each method are met in the context of your specific study.” In this tutorial, we will focus on DiD because it is the most commonly used tool and the easiest to implement. We briefly discuss regression-discontinuity. We do not discuss Instrumental variables, because they are rarely applicable in applied research."

This method is used when we have data from both before and after an intervention, for both a treatment group and a control group. By comparing the changes in outcomes over time between these groups, DiD helps us isolate the effect of the intervention from other factors that are changing over time. The Difference-in-Differences (DiD) approach is a quasi-experimental technique used in econometrics and statistics to estimate the effect of a specific intervention or treatment by comparing the changes in outcomes over time between a group that’s exposed to the intervention (treatment group) and a group that is not (control group). The equation on this slide represents a basic DiD model: Yit=α+β1Treatmenti+β2Postt+γ(Treatmenti×Postt)+ϵitYit=α+β1Treatmenti+β2Postt+γ(Treatmenti×Postt)+ϵit Here’s what each term represents: - Yit is the outcome variable for unit i at time t. - α is the constant term or the baseline level of the outcome. - Treatmenti is an indicator variable that equals 1 if the observation ii belongs to the treatment group, and 0 otherwise. - Postt is an indicator for the post-treatment period, equaling 1 if the observation is after the intervention has been implemented, and 0 if before. - γ is the coefficient of interest, which represents the interaction between the treatment and the post period. This interaction term captures the differential effect of the treatment over time compared to the control group. - ϵit is the error term."

This approach will help us understand how to implement DiD and interpret its output practically. By simulating data that mimics a controlled experiment, we can visually comprehend how DiD estimates the effect of an intervention First, we load two essential R libraries. dplyr is used for data manipulation, and modelsummary will help us to summarize models easily and produce nice tables for our results. Then we set the seed of R’s random number generator, which helps in ensuring that the results are reproducible. The same set of random numbers can be generated again, which is crucial for simulations. Next, we generate a dataset with three variables: - treatment: A binary variable where 1 represents the treatment group and 0 represents the control group. It’s repeated 100 times to match the number of observations. - post: A binary variable indicating whether the observation is post-treatment (1) or pre-treatment (0). It is repeated 50 times and cycled twice to align with the treatment periods. - outcome: The outcome variable, generated using a normal distribution. The means and standard deviations are set to simulate the effect of the treatment over time. The treatment group in the post-treatment period has a higher mean (12) compared to the pre-treatment period (10), which illustrates the impact of the intervention. This simulation setup allows us to apply the DiD analysis on a dataset where we know the true impact of the intervention, thus providing a clear way to evaluate the effectiveness of the DiD method. By comparing the outcomes before and after the treatment in both the treated and control groups, we can observe how the DiD estimator works in practice."

The first line of code fits a linear regression model (lm) where the outcome variable is regressed on the interactions between the treatment and post variables. The treatment * post syntax includes both the main effects of the treatment and post variables and their interaction term. This interaction term is the key to the DiD analysis, as it estimates the additional effect of being in the treatment group post-intervention relative to pre-intervention and control group changes. The next block uses the modelsummary function to create a summarized table of the model outputs: - List of Models: Two models are summarized here. The first is a simpler model without the interaction term, and the second is the full DiD model. - Estimate Formatting: The output format includes the estimated coefficients ({estimate}), significance stars ({stars}), and standard errors ({std.error}) in parentheses. - Goodness of Fit (gof) Omissions: The gof_omit parameter specifies which model fit indicators to omit from the summary, such as - - Information Criteria (IC), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), etc. - Output: The summary is set to be outputted as a PowerPoint table (table.pptx), which is useful for presentation purposes.\nFinally, we interpret the results\nCoefficients: Look for the coefficient of the interaction term (treatment:post). This coefficient tells you the estimated effect of the treatment, adjusted for baseline differences and trends over time. Significance: Significance levels (indicated by stars) give an idea of the statistical significance of the estimates. Commonly, * p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01, *** p&lt;0.001. Standard Errors: These provide a measure of the variability of the coefficient estimates. Smaller standard errors suggest more precise estimates.\nIf the interaction term is statistically significant and positive, it suggests that the treatment had a positive effect on the outcome, over and above any baseline or time-related effects. The size of the coefficient on the interaction term quantifies the magnitude of this effect. Comparing the two models in the summary (with and without the interaction term) can also provide insights into the importance of considering the interaction between treatment and time for capturing the causal effect accurately.\nHere, we focus on Model 2, which is the differences-in-differences model:\nThe intercept (12.078)* represents the adjusted average baseline outcome for the control group before the intervention, slightly higher here due to adjustments in the model. The treatment (-1.785)* indicator coefficient is significantly larger and still negative, which reinforces the observation that the treatment group was initially performing worse than the control group. The post (-2.585)* coefficient indicates a substantial decline in the outcome for the control group in the post-treatment period, even more pronounced than in Model 1.\nThe crucial insight from Model 2 is the interaction term (Treatment × Post), which indicates that the treatment effectively improved outcomes by about 2.361 units in the post period, relative to what would have been expected based on the pre-period trends and the initial negative impact of the treatment. This suggests the treatment’s effectiveness becomes apparent only when considering its temporal implementation."

The Parallel Trends Assumption is critical and assumes that in the absence of treatment, the average outcomes for the treated and control groups would have followed parallel paths over time. This means any difference between these groups over time can be attributed to the treatment and not to other factors. To validate the parallel trends assumption, we need data for at least two time points before the intervention. More time points can increase the robustness of the model by allowing for more complex specifications and validation of the parallel trends assumption. The simplicity of DiD can also be a limitation. For instance, if other events affect the treated and control groups differently at the same time as the treatment (confounding events), this can bias the results. Moreover, the method only ensures balance on observed characteristics; unobserved biases that vary over time can still affect the outcome.\nFinally, estimation can get much more complicated when the treatment affects different treatment units at different times or when the treatment “turns on and off”."

This could be something like a test score determining eligibility for a scholarship, where the cutoff score is the threshold. In RDD, we make a critical assumption: individuals who are just below and just above this cutoff are similar in all respects except for the exposure to the treatment. This assumption is crucial because it implies that any differences observed between these two groups can be attributed to the treatment effect and not to other underlying differences. It must be the case that subjects cannot change their behavior to ensure that they fall on one side of the cutoff instead of the other, which we refer to as “sorting”. Using RDD allows researchers to estimate what we call the Local Average Treatment Effect, or LATE. This measure tells us the effect of the treatment on those who are precisely at the threshold—those who are affected by being just above or just below the cutoff. It is important to note that this effect may not generalize to individuals further from the threshold. This method is particularly powerful in settings where randomized control trials are impractical or unethical. It provides a robust way to measure the impact of treatments or interventions in a natural setting, making it a valuable tool in our statistical toolbox."

We are focusing on the effect of a merit-based scholarship on future earnings after college.\nImagine we want to analyze whether receiving a merit-based scholarship to attend college influences a person’s earnings after they graduate. The relationship we’re interested in is straightforward: does the scholarship lead to higher earnings? To explore this, one might think about running a simple regression model where earnings after college depend on whether a person received a scholarship. The model might look something like this:\nEarningsi=α+β×Scholarshipi+ϵiEarningsi=α+β×Scholarshipi+ϵi\nHere, αα represents the baseline earnings, ββ represents the effect of the scholarship, and ϵiϵi is the error term.\nHowever, there’s a significant problem with this approach: confounding variables. People who earn merit-based scholarships are likely different from those who do not in several important ways. They might have higher grades, better test scores, or more drive and ambition. These differences can influence their future earnings independently of the scholarship. Thus, any analysis that doesn’t account for these factors might mistakenly attribute the effect of these underlying characteristics to the scholarship itself. This is a classic example of the confounding problem in causal inference."

The goal here is to create equivalent groups that mimic the conditions of a randomized experiment by focusing our analysis on units with characteristics that are common in both the treatment and control group. This approach is particularly useful in observational studies. For example, in healthcare research, patients receiving different treatments can be matched based on variables such as age, pre-existing conditions, and lifestyle choices to assess the effectiveness of a new drug or treatment protocol. Matching and weighting techniques rely on the assumption of “ignorability” or “conditional independence assumption” (CIA). This assumption holds that once you control for the observed covariates, the assignment to the treatment group is as good as random. In practical terms, this means all confounders must be observed and correctly measured so that any two units with the same values on observed covariates have the same potential outcomes irrespective of treatment status. In other words, the key assumption underpinning this method is that units matched on observables are comparable. However, it is impossible to validate this assumption, posing a fundamental limitation of this method. Many matching and weighting methods, particularly those that rely on propensity scores, perform better with large samples. In smaller samples, these methods may struggle to find appropriate matches, reducing the statistical power of the study and increasing the variance of the estimate. Importantly, these methods can be paired with DiD designs to make the parallel trends assumption more realistic."

Statistical power is defined as the probability that our test will correctly reject a false null hypothesis. In simpler terms, it’s the likelihood that our study will actually detect an effect if there is one to be found. Why is power important? Without sufficient power, our study might miss detecting real effects, leading to what we call a Type II error, or a false negative. This means we might conclude there is no effect when, in fact, there is one. If a treatment has a positive impact, but we conclude that it doesn’t, this can waste valuable resources and deprive people of welfare-enhancing benefits. Several key factors influence the power of a statistical test. First, the sample size: larger sample sizes increase the power of a test, improving our chances of detecting an effect. Second, the effect size: if the effect we are looking for is larger, it will be easier to detect. Third, the significance level, typically set at 0.05 for many tests. Lowering this level makes it harder to achieve statistical significance, which can reduce power, though it also makes it less likely to get a false positive. Lastly, variability in our data: less variability means our effects are more discernible, which increases power. Therefore, it’s crucial to conduct a power analysis during the design phase of a study. This analysis will help us determine the necessary sample size and other parameters to ensure our study has adequate power to detect meaningful effects. By planning for power, we maximize the reliability and validity of our research findings"

This can be extremely important. Any individual approach to measuring an outcome might be subject to unexpected measurement error. For example, if we want to measure the effect of an intervention on civic engagement, survey-based measures asking about recent behavior are vulnerable to subjects over-stating their engagement or mis-remembering the number of times they’ve participated in politics. For this reason, we might also want to consult administrative records whether a person voted or volunteered with community organizations. However, when we test the same hypotheses using multiple different measures, we encounter a significant statistical challenge known as multiple hypothesis testing. This issue arises because the more tests we perform, the higher the likelihood of encountering a false positive. Essentially, if we conduct, say, 20 tests, each at a significance level of 5%, we might expect one of those tests to show significant results purely by chance, even if all our null hypotheses are true. Traditionally, statisticians have used methods such as the Bonferroni correction to adjust the significance levels when multiple comparisons are made. Essentially, this increases the level of statistical significance required to conclude that an effect exists. However, these methods reduce the power of statistical tests, increasing the risk of falsely concluding that a treatment was not effective. Especially in the context of expensive IEs where sample sizes are often small, such corrections should be avoided when possible. This is where index measures come into play. By combining several indicators into a single index, we reduce the total number of hypotheses being tested. This consolidation not only simplifies our analysis but also inherently controls for the risk of multiple hypothesis testing errors. Consequently, our statistical analysis becomes not just simpler, but more accurate and meaningful, focusing on robust, interpretable results rather than being clouded by potential statistical anomalies."

Now, let’s talk about when it’s appropriate to use an additive scale. This method is particularly useful when the variables you’re combining are measured on a common scale. This ensures that each variable contributes equally to the final index score. An additive scale is also beneficial when you’re interested in a cumulative quantity of something. For example, if you want to measure the total number of times an individual has engaged in a specific behavior, or if you’re looking to calculate the total amount of money received from several different sources. By using an additive scale, you can create a single measure that represents a comprehensive view of these cumulative or combined behaviors or contributions, making your data analysis both simpler and more meaningful."

A z-score, or standard score, is a way to describe a value’s relationship to the mean of a group of values, measured in terms of standard deviations from the mean. Mathematically, it’s expressed as Z=(X−μ)/σZ=(X−μ)/σ, where X is the variable, μ is the mean of that variable, and σ is the variable’s standard deviation. This standardization process transforms the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Now, when should we use averaged z-scores? This approach is particularly useful in two scenarios: - When variables are measured on different scales: If you’re working with variables that have different units or scales, converting them into z-scores allows them to be compared and combined meaningfully. This is because z-scores normalize the data, removing the units and putting everything on a common scale. - When variables cannot be summed directly: There are cases where it’s not appropriate or possible to sum variables directly, perhaps due to their differing natures or units. Averaged z-scores provide a way to aggregate these variables into a single index while retaining the statistical integrity of the data. By averaging these standardized scores, we can create composite indices that allow us to conduct a single hypotheses that combines multiple measures of the same outcome."

Firstly, interpretability is a major advantage. By transforming our data into z-scores, we represent each value as its distance from the mean in terms of standard deviations. This means that the transformed data points tell us how many standard deviations they lie from the average. A z-score of +1.0 indicates a value one standard deviation above the mean, while -1.0 indicates one standard deviation below. This standardization makes it easier to understand where each data point stands in relation to the group average, enhancing our ability to interpret complex data sets. For this reason, z-scores are often used to report the results of IEs. A general rule of thumb is that effects of less than 0.2 standard deviations is a small effect, between .2 and .4 is a medium effect, and anything above .4 is a very large effect. Another significant benefit is in outlier detection. By using the criterion of z-scores exceeding an absolute value of 3, we can easily identify outliers. Values that fall beyond three standard deviations from the mean are typically considered extreme. It is often important to drop extreme values from analyses to ensure that these outliers are not driving your findings."

PCA is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. This technique is especially useful when you want to reduce the dimensionality of your dataset while retaining as much variance as possible. It helps in creating a new underlying variable that explains most of the variability in your data. Next, Factor Analysis is another technique that is similar to PCA but focuses more on latent variables that cannot be measured directly. This method examines the interrelationships among a large number of variables and condenses them into a few factors for easier interpretation and analysis. Factor analysis is particularly useful when your variables are related and you suspect that they are measuring underlying factors. Lastly, Inverse Covariance Weighting. This method weights variables inversely to their covariance with other variables, aiming to minimize the impact of highly correlated variables in the analysis. It’s a way to adjust the contribution of each variable to the index based on how much unique information it provides."

Let’s start by understanding what an interaction term is. In simple linear regression models, we typically assume that the effect of one predictor on the outcome variable is independent of other factors. However, this assumption often oversimplifies reality, as the impact of a predictor can vary depending on the levels or presence of another predictor. This is crucial in fields such as medicine, where the effectiveness of a treatment might depend on patients’ age or genetic background, and in economics, where the impact of a policy might differ across regions or demographic groups. For example, we might want to test the impact of a new teaching method on students test scores. However, we might expect that the effectiveness of this new teaching method in improving students’ test scores differs between students from low and high socioeconomic backgrounds. You might also recognize interaction terms from our difference-in-differences tutorial. In policy evaluation, interaction terms are used to implement the difference-in-differences estimation. This technique compares the before-and-after differences in outcomes between a treatment group and a control group, thus controlling for common trends that might affect both groups. Interaction terms are incorporated into regression models to allow us to estimate how the effect of one variable changes as another variable changes. Essentially, these terms help us identify and quantify synergies or interdependencies between variables."

This is particularly useful in policy analysis, medical research, and economic studies, where the effect of an intervention may depend on individual or contextual characteristics. Imagine Xi1 captures whether or not at student was exposed to the new teaching method and Xi2 captures whether or not the student is high-socioeconomic status. If the interaction term β3 is significantly positive, it suggests that high SES students benefit more from the new method compared to low SES students.

    "text": "Research Design\nI will use a linear model to estimate the relationship between levels of political engagement and whether or not an individual has moved to a new city. This design relies on the assumption that individuals that moved to a new city had similar propensities to participate to those that did not, conditional on observable covariates.\nWhile this assumption is unrealistic, I will take several measures to rule-out potential sources of baseline differences in the propensity of moving and non-moving students to participate.\nFirst, I will identify specific types of participation that are more and less likely to be affected by whether at student moves. If my hypothesis is correct, we should expect to see the more likely forms of participation to be different between moving and non-moving students, while the less likely forms of participation should nto be different between moving and non-moving students.\nSecond, I will condition my analysis to students that move from one urban place to another urban place. While students that move from a rural area to a city are likely to be different in many important ways that could affect their propensity to participate, those that move from one city to another city will be less different.\nThird, I will condition my analysis on students socio-economic status (SES). SES is one of the strongest predictors of political engagement, and students from different SES backgrounds will be different in ways that affect their propensity to participate.\nFourth, I will account for the length of time since respondents moved to their new city. My mechanisms linking moving to a new city with lower engagement (information and social ties) would predict that this effect reduces over time. Therefore, the gap between moving and non-moving students should be smaller for respondents that have been in their new city for longer."

First, we use variables based on survey questions measuring respondent demographics, including whether or not the student is originally from Addis Ababa, whether they came from an urban or rural setting, the number of years they have been at university, and whether or not they work to support themselves and receive financial support from their parents.

In a new tab, open this interactive visualization of how sample size leads to better estimates of population parameters. Follow the instructions to watch how increases in sample size lead to a sample that is more and more similar to the population. Random samples exhibit natural “sampling variation” that leads to any specific sample to have a parameter value that is above or below the true value of the parameter in the population that you are trying to infer from the sample.

A sampling frame is a comprehensive list of every unit in the population. If your population of interest is the citizens of a country, you may be able to get a sampling frame through a census or through government records. If a recent census or administrative records aren’t available, you might need to construct a sampling frame yourself. - In development research, we often mix these two approaches in multi-stage sampling. For example, to collect a random sample of citizens in a specific city to complete a survey, you might first randomly sample neighborhoods from government records and then work with community leaders in each neighborhood to create a list of every household from which you can draw a random sample."

This approach allows the results from the sample to be generalized to the larger population, which is a key aspect of statistical inference. There are multiple approaches to random sampling, which we will discuss below. However, they all assume that your data collection is perfect, meaning that you are able to successfull collect data from every unit that is selected to be included in the sample. In the real world, this is almost never the case. We will return to issues of non-response at the end of this activity."

In SRS, each unit within the population has the exact some probability of being included in your sample. However, it is often logistically difficult to collect data in this manner. For example, if you randomly select citizens from the entire population to answer an in-person survey, you will probably need to send an enumerator to a different part of the country for every citizen (unless you randomly sample multiple respondents that live near one another by chance). Also, SRS can miss small but important groups within the population. If you want to make inferences about parameter values for subgroups within the population, such as citizens living in a specific region of the country, you may need a more sophisticated approach to random sampling."

This approach can help to ensure that we collect enough data about various groups within the population so that we can make inferences about those groups. Here, we begin by dividing the population into groups of similar units, for example by gender or geographic location. We then randomly sample a certain number of units from within those strata. This decreases the risk that members of certain strata will be absent or under-represented in your sample. The number of units sampled from each strata can be constant across strata (will will lead small groups to be over-represented or over-sampled compared to their share of the broader population) or proportional to their share of the broader population. If the number of units from each strata does not correspond to that strata’s share of the population, you must apply weights when estimating the value of population parameters. It is important to note that, in order to perform stratified sampling, you must have data on which strata each unit belongs to in your sample frame."

Citizens with more years of education may be less likely to respond, or schools with worse records of on-time payments might be less able to provide accurate data. - If the characteristics that make units select whether to be included are also correlated with the population characteristic that you want to estimate, this creates bias. - This introduces what we call “selection bias,” meaning that sampling is no longer random because certain units select whether to be included in the sample - All data collection suffers from selection bias, so it is important to think carefully about how the specific types of bias you encountered might affect your estimates of population characteristics."

To reduce unit non-response, you can offer incentives or apply weighting to try to account for higher levels of non-response among certain types of units. To reduce item non-response, you can allow individual surveys to be self-administered or emphasize anonymity to reduce hesitation to sharing information. However, none of these strategies are guaranteed to work, so it is always important to investigate patterns in both unit and item non-response in your sample. Investigate whether sampled units in certain areas or strata were less likely to provide data than others, or whether certain types of units were less likely to provide certain types of data or information."

It also adds its own features, including graphical interfaces and features for managing projects. GitHub provides a central location where data analysts can publish their repositories and collaborate with others.

A Git repo is a virtual storage of your project, allowing you to save versions of your code and track changes made over time. It consists of all the project’s files and the entire revision history.\nData and code for individual projects are stored in a dedicated repo. The repo is hosted remotely on github.com and stored locally on your computer’s harddrive. Repos exist on your hard drive as a normal folder (usually within a larger folder that includes all active git repositories you are working on).

It can be runs on a wide variety of operating systems, including Linux, Windows, and MacOS. RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that provides an interface by adding many convenient features and tools.\nYou can think of R as a car’s engine and RStudio as the dashboard. In the same way that having access to a speedometer and a navigation system makes driving much easier, using RStudio’s interface makes using R much easier as well.\nR and RStudio are entirely free and updated on a regular basis, making them much more accessible and widely used than paid alternatives. You can conduct nearly any analysis using R, ranging from calculating the average of a variable to creating maps and conducting spatial analysis to conducting the analysis for an impact evaluation.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload and install R by going to https://cloud.r-project.org/\n\nWindows: Click on “Download R for Windows”, then click on “base”, then click on the Download link\nmacOS user: Click on “Download R for macOS”, then under “Latest release:” click on R-X.X.X.pkg, where R-X.X.X is the version number\nLinux user: Click on “Download R for Linux” and choose your distribution for more information on installing R for your setup\n\n\n\nIf you don’t have R and RStudio already installed, that will be the first step. You will first need to download and install both R and RStudio (Desktop version) on your computer. It is important that you install R first and then install RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload and install RStudio at https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/\n\nScroll down to “Installers for Supported Platforms” near the bottom of the page\nClick on the download link corresponding to your computer’s operating system\n\n\n\nOnce you have installed R, you can now install RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing R by opening RStudio\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter you open RStudio, you should see something like this\n\n\n\nNote the three panes which are three panels dividing the screen: the console pane, the files pane, and the environment pane. Over the course of this tutorial, you’ll come to learn what purpose each of these panes serves.\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomize the appearance of your R IDE by going to Tools -&gt; Global Options -&gt; Appearance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRstudio contains 4 panes: source, console, environment, and viewer\nThe left pane is the source where you write code\nTry typing 2 + 2 into the source panel and hitting ENTER\n\nThe console panel pop-up in the bottom-left and return a value of 4\n\n\n[INSERT SCREEN RECORDING]\n\n\n\n\nThe top-right includes the Environment panel\n\nThis contains information about any objects that you load into your environment\nType sum = 2 + 2 into the source and hit ENTER\nThe object sum should appear in your environment\n\nThe bottom-right includes the Viewer panel, where you will be able to see graphics that you generate\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning code: telling R to perform an act by giving it commands in the source or console\nObjects: where values are saved in R. On the last slide, you created the object sum.\nData types:\n\nIntegers are whole numbers like -1, 0, 2, 4092\nDoubles are integers with decimal values like -24.932 and 0.8\nLogicals are either TRUE or FALSE\nCharacters are text or strings like \"hello world\" and \"welcome to R\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVectors are a series of values. These are created using the c() function. For example, c(6, 11, 13, 31) creates a four element vector of integers.\nFactors are a group of characters/strings with a fixed number of unique values\nData frames are objects where the rows correspond to observations and the columns correspond to variables that describe the observations\n\n\n\n\n\nConditionals:\n\nTesting for equality in R is done using ==. For example, 2 + 1 == 3 will return TRUE\nBoolean algebra: Operators such as &lt; (less than), &lt;= (less than or equal), and !=(not equal to). For example, 3 + 5 &lt;= 1 will return FALSE\nLogical operators: & represent “and” while | represents “or.” For example, (2 + 1 == 3) & (2 + 1 == 4) returns FALSE since both clauses are not TRUE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR gives you accesss to thousands of “packages” that are created by users\nPackages contain datasets and bundles of code called “functions” that can execute specific tasks\nUse install.packages() to install a package\n\nInsert the name of the package contained in quotation marks\nStart by installing the dplyr package\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoad data into your environment by “reading-in” a spreadsheet\nSpreadsheets should be saved as a .csv file\nUse read.csv() to pull data from a spreadsheet on your harddrive into your R/RStudio environment\n\nWithin the parentheses, add the full file pathway where the .csv file is stored\n\n\n[INSERT SCREEN RECORDING]\n\n\n\n\nWhen you run code, R often provides feedback in the console\nThere are 3 main types of feedback that appear in RED\n\nErrors: When the RED text is prefaced with “Error in…”, your code will not work. The error message will try to explain the problem.\nWarnings: When the red text is prefaced with “Warning:”, your code will still work, but there still might be a problem. The warning message will try to explain the problem.\nMessages: When the red text doesn’t start with “Error” or “Warning”, it’s just a friendly message"

Measurements taken at baseline have the suffix _baseline included in the column name; for example, q11_3 is the endline measurement and q11_3_baseline is the baseline measurement.\nSome of these variables are described below:\n\nresponse_id: A unique identifier for each respondent\ntreatment_status: A binary indicator taking a value of 1 for respondents assigned to receive an invitation to the treatment workshop\nuser_language: A categorical variable indicating whether the respondent took the survey in English, Ahmaric, or Afan\nq3_baseline: A categorical variable indicating whether the respondent identifies as Male or Female            \nFuture plans for a career in public sector or civil society\n\nq26_civ: Plan to work in civil society\nq26_politics: Plan to work in politics\nq26_public: Plan to work in public sector\nq27_1: Plan to run for political office\nq27_3: Plan to start a non-governmental organization\n\nFeelings of political efficacy\n\nq17_3: Your participation can bring positive change\nq17_1: Youth are given opportunities to engage\nq17_2: Youth participation can bring positive change\n\n\nRequirement 1 (10%)\nFor all variables after user_language, please rename the column with a descriptive name that better conveys their meaning.

You should end up with 6 variables in your dataframe.\nRequirement 5 (15%)\nUsing baseline values only, estimate a model regressing your “Future plans” index on your “Feelings of political efficacy” index.
