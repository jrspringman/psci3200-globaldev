    "text": "Course Description and Objectives\nRecent years have seen a tremendous growth in the amount of data available and our ability to process it. This raises the exciting possibility that these advances can be used to improve governance and benefit the world’s poor. In this course, students will engage with cutting-edge research that deploys new data and contemporary social science research methods and gain hands-on experience analyzing diverse types of data using rigorous research designs and broadly useful computational tools.\nThe course will be organized around several timely substantive topics in global development, including democratic backsliding and autocratization, citizen engagement, crime and corruption, and climate change and migration. As we explore these topics, students will gain a deeper understanding of the challenges that shape governance and development outcomes and ways that contemporary social science and the development ‘industry’ seeks to address them.\nAt the same time, students will be introduced to data analysis methods, inferential techniques, and computational tools that are useful across a wide range of applications. Specifically, students will deepen their understanding of basic statistical methods common to the social sciences, learn how these methods can be used to make inferences about population characteristics and causal relationships, and prepare documents that contain reproducible data analysis workflows.\nAt the end of the course you should be able to:\n\nEvaluate the quality of evidence in the development field\nThink clearly about how data can be used to learn about development and governance challenges\nUse tools for data analysis such as R, RStudio, Quarto, and GitHub\nProduce professional-quality documents that summarize original research\n\nI hope that this course will encourage both passion and measured optimism about the potential for contemporary social science tools to address complex problems affecting governance and development in less developed countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\n\nThis class is designed as a follow-up to PSCI 1102. Students that have not taken PSCI 1102 and PSCI 1800 (or an equivalent) should contact the instructor before enrolling."

All other reading materials will be uploaded to this website or circulated on Slack at least one week before the meeting.\n\nBooks\nStudents are required to purchase a copy of Data Analysis for Social Science: A Friendly and Practical Introduction (DSS). We will use DSS as a jumping-off point for this course. While students are expected to already be familiar with many of the tools and concepts covered by this book, it will serve as a method to review core concepts and orient discussion about how to expand on these skills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired book\n\n\n\nI am asking students to purchase a copy of DSS because it comes with access to additional, helpful resources. If you are unable to purchase this book, you must let me know. To save money, consider e-renting the textbook.\n\n\n\n\nComputing\nIn the course, we will be using R for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. R is free, open source statistical computing environment available on all major operating systems. We will also be using RStudio, a free, widely used graphical interface for R. For document preparation, we will be using Quarto, a free, open-source scientific and technical publishing system that is compatible with both R/RStudio and Python, as well as several other languages. Both Quarto and RStudio are supported by a company called Posit. For version control, we will be using Github.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired software\n\n\n\nStudents are expected to already have R and RStudio installed on the personal computer that they will be using for class. We will cover the installation of all other required computing tools during the course.\n\n\nSeveral course requirements will require you to write and submit R code. Your code must be appropriately commented and reproducible. To ensure your code meets the course standards, please follow this style guide from Hadley Wickham (Chief Scientist at Posit and developer of ggplot2 and tidyverse)."

    "text": "Course Structure\nSubstantively, the course is divided into several parts. Part 1 presents a general introduction to the course and a brief introduction to correlation, causality and statistical inference. The remaining parts are structured around key substantive topics in development. For each topic, we will begin with a brief overview of the literature. Then, we will focus on one particular research question and use it as a guide to learn how to implement some of the most common research designs in the social sciences. Throughout, you will gain hands-on experience with diverse kinds of data through in-class workshops and data assignments. Weekly reading assignments will be divided between contemporary research on substantive topics in global development and textbook chapters focused on social science research methods. You are expected to attend class and be prepared to engage in discussion about the assigned readings.\n\n\nGrading\nPerformance in this class will be evaluated by according to performance on the following course requirements:\n\n\n\nRequirement\nPercent of Final Grade\n\n\n\n\nQuizzes (4)\n10%\n\n\nWorkshops (4)\n10%\n\n\nData Assignments (3)\n36%\n\n\nFinal Project (1)\n44%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBump-up policy\n\n\n\nI reserve the right to “bump up” the grades of students who have made valuable contributions to the course, including participation in lectures or workshops or helping other students by answering questions on Slack. This also applies to students who show tremendous progress over the semester.\n\n\n\n\nRequirement Descriptions\nThere are four graded requirements for this course.\nQuizzes\n\nYou are expected to attend each course meeting. On four randomly selected meetings, there will be a brief quiz designed to test whether or not students did the readings. Students with a pre-approved absence will be required to take the quiz remotely within 24 hours of its administration (in the event your absence falls on a quiz date). Students will be permitted one pre-approved absence for the semester.\nGrade: 10%\n\nWorkshops\n\nWe will have four workshops throughout the semester. These will be interactive, hands-on workshops allowing students to gain familiarity with new statistical methods or computational tools. These workshops will cover important tools, such as quarto and github, and data analysis tasks, including cleaning, visualization, and modeling. After each workshop, you will be required to submit a product (ex. the link to a git repo, a quarto doc, an R script, etc.) demonstrating completion of the workshop.\nGrade: 10%\n\nData Assignments\n\nThere will be three data assignments throughout the semester. These assignments are designed to give you an opportunity to apply tools and methods discussed in readings, lectures, and workshops to data from the real world. Where possible, we will use data collected by DevLab@Penn researchers. These are individual assignments. While I encourage you to collaborate with your colleagues as you think through the tasks, you will be required to submit your own code and write-up.\nGrade: 36%\n\n\n\n\nData Assignment\nDue Date\n\n\n\n\nAssignment 1\nMar 28th 11:59pm ET\n\n\nAssignment 2\nApr 11th 11:59pm ET\n\n\nAssignment 3\nApr 25th 11:59pm ET\n\n\n\nFinal Project\n\nThe final project is a data analysis project that will use data of your choosing. The only stipulation is that this data must be relevant to one of the global development topics covered in this course. The assignment will require you to formulate a research question, find data that can help you answer that question, apply the tools and methods from this course to the data you have selected to answer your research question, and present those results for public consumption.\nThe goal will be to produce a professional project that can showcase the skills that you have gained to potential employers. Your final submission will be a publicly available webpage that contains: (1) a brief introduction to your research question and data; (2) a discussion of your research design, its assumptions, and threats to inference; (3) a visualization that describes your data; (4) a presentation of the results from a regression model (as a table or graph) and discussion of its implications for your research question; and (5) a discussion of the implications of your findings for development policy or practice, including the limitations of your analysis and suggestions for future research. In addition to the public-facing webpage, you must share access to a GitHub repo that contains the code to reproduce the project output.\nGrade: 44%\n\n\n\n\nMilestone\nDue Date\n\n\n\n\nCreate a GitHub repository\nFeb 8th 11:59pm ET\n\n\nIdea for research question and data source\nMar 12th 11:59pm ET\n\n\nSubmit proposal (research question and design)\nApr 11th 11:59pm ET\n\n\nSubmit final project (webpage url and repo)\nMay 2nd 11:59pm ET"

    "text": "Course Policies\nPlease review these course policies carefully. Any questions or concerns about these policies should be raised during the first week of class.\n\nLate Submissions and Regrading\nLate submission of assignments will incur a penalty of 2 points for every day late, except in documented cases of serious illness or family emergency. If you feel there has been an error in the grading of one your assignment, you may request in writing a regrade of the assignment. First, I will request a detailed write-up of your dispute. Second, I will regrade the entire assignment, not just the part you are disputing. Therefore, your regrade might increase or decrease the overall grade on the assignment.\n\n\nUse of AI Tools\nYou are welcome to use generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, to assist you with your work in this course. There is mounting evidence from rigorous research that these tools increase human productivity. I believe that their use will continue to proliferate, so it is important to gain experience integrating them into professional tasks. However, AI tools frequently make errors and ‘hallucinate’ information about things that do not exist (journal articles, R functions, etc.). It is your responsibility to verify the information provided by such tools. Most importantly, you are required to disclose your use of AI tools for assignments in the form of footnotes or citations. The use of AI tools will not be counted against you. On the contrary, I want to adopt and share your clever or innovative applications of AI tools.\n\n\nElectronic Devices\nLaptops will be required in class. All other electronic devices should be silenced and hidden. If there is an emergency situation and your phone must be visible, please inform me at the beginning of class. Please don’t make me come up with consequences for violating this policy.\n\n\nControversial Topics and Statements\nIn our exploration of global development, we will strive to maintain an inclusive learning environment. I believe that respect for diverse perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds is essential for effective development research and practice. If you feel that statements made during class (by other students or by me) have undermined this, please contact me directly so that we can address the issue.\nThis course may deal with subject-matter that is difficult or controversial. It is crucial to approach these topics with sensitivity and openness. Students are required to treat one another with respect, even in cases of disagreement. At times, research findings may be in-tension with your normative commitments. I urge students to engage earnestly and critically with any evidence that challenges your prior beliefs.\n\n\nAcademic Honesty\nStudents are expected to follow the University of Pennsylvania’s Code of Academic Integrity. Suspected violations will be referred to university administration for disciplinary action. If you have any doubts or questions about what constitutes academic misconduct, please do not hesitate to contact me."

These resources are available for a reason, and students should feel comfortable taking full advantage of them. I am not an expert in accessing these resources, but I will be happy to help you secure support that will help you succeed at Penn.\n\nMental Health\nYour mental health is important to me. Struggles with mental health, as well as serious mental illnesses, are common across students, faculty, and staff. Please feel free to reach out to me about issues you are having within or outside of this course. I emphatically encourage anyone who thinks they may benefit to utilize the university resources listed below:\n\nCounseling and Mental Health Services\n24/7 Services: 215-746-9355\n\nPlease note that this list is not comprehensive.

The Weingarten Center partners with other departments throughout campus to coordinate and improve the accessibility of buildings and grounds, transportation, communication, and digital infrastructure. Students that require academic accommodations should contact the Weingarten Center. Academic accommodations are determined on an individualized basis through an interactive process that involves student self-disclosure, documentation of disability, and an initial meeting with a Disability Specialist. Accommodations do not alter fundamental requirements of the course and are not retroactive. Students should request accommodations as early as possible, since they may take time to implement. Students can notify the Weingarten Center at any time during the semester if adjustments to their communicated accommodation plan are needed."

    "text": "Requirements\nThis assignment has four components. The components are presented below, along with their importance for the grading of the overall assignment.\n\nDescribe your research question and provide some background on why you find it interesting or important. Be sure to incorporate the feedback provided on the first assignment. Include references to at least two pieces of existing research that illustrate what has already been discovered about the relationship you are investigating. This could be articles published in academic journals, policy reports and white papers, articles published by think tanks and other credible organizations (ex. Brookings, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, etc.), or pieces of data journalism. A full-credit response will probably be around 150-200 words. (40%)\nState at least one testable hypothesis. Distill your research question into a statement about a specific relationship you expect to see in the world. In most cases, this hypothesis will describe a causal relationship between two variables (i.e. changes in x cause changes in y). Make an argument for why you expect to see this relationship. This should be based on related findings from existing research and/or your own theoretical/logical reasoning. A full-credit response will probably be around 150-200 words. (25%)\nBriefly discuss the specific variables you will use to test your hypothesis and the dataset they are drawn from. Be sure to mention the source of the data (the organization or individuals that produced it), the unit of analysis, and the sample. Create a ggplot to visualize the relationship between the variables being used to test your hypothesis. The best method of visualizing this relationship will depend on the scale of your variables. Good methods to consider are scatter plots (for continuous variables), grouped bar charts (for ordinal or binary variables), and line graphs (for continuous variables with time-series). (25%)\nSpecify the main regression model you will use to test your hypothesis. This regression model should provide a preliminary test for or against the validity of your hypothesis. Use markdown to render the equation neatly to the html file. (10%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA hypothesis should look like a prediction. Often, a hypothesis states that you expect a decrease or increase in one variable to cause a decrease or increase in another variable. A hypothesis must also be falsifiable. In other words, it must be possible to prove that the hypothesis is false by showing that the relationship you are predicting to see in your data is not actually present.\n\n\nIn the next assignment, you will be asked to discuss the assumptions that your research design is making. For example, you will need to describe the assumptions that are necessary to interpret your regression model as evidence for your hypothesis. You will also be asked to propose additional tests that can help justify these assumptions, using variables that are available in your dataset."

    "text": "Research Design\nI will use a linear model to estimate the relationship between levels of political engagement and whether or not an individual has moved to a new city. This design relies on the assumption that individuals that moved to a new city had similar propensities to participate to those that did not, conditional on observable covariates.\nWhile this assumption is unrealistic, I will take several measures to rule-out potential sources of baseline differences in the propensity of moving and non-moving students to participate.\nFirst, I will identify specific types of participation that are more and less likely to be affected by whether at student moves. If my hypothesis is correct, we should expect to see the more likely forms of participation to be different between moving and non-moving students, while the less likely forms of participation should nto be different between moving and non-moving students.\nSecond, I will condition my analysis to students that move from one urban place to another urban place. While students that move from a rural area to a city are likely to be different in many important ways that could affect their propensity to participate, those that move from one city to another city will be less different.\nThird, I will condition my analysis on students socio-economic status (SES). SES is one of the strongest predictors of political engagement, and students from different SES backgrounds will be different in ways that affect their propensity to participate.\nFourth, I will account for the length of time since respondents moved to their new city. My mechanisms linking moving to a new city with lower engagement (information and social ties) would predict that this effect reduces over time. Therefore, the gap between moving and non-moving students should be smaller for respondents that have been in their new city for longer."

AAU is Ethiopia’s top university, and students from around the country (and the continent) move to Addis Ababa in order to study there. Given the frequency with which youth move to a new city in order to obtain education, and the importance of universities and sites of political socialization, this is an important context in which to study the effects of moving on participation."

This data contains two waves collected in May-June and October-November of 2022. A total of 825 students completed both waves of the survey.\nThe variables being used fall into two categories. First, we use variables based on survey questions measuring respondent demographics, including whether or not the student is originally from Addis Ababa, whether they came from an urban or rural setting, the number of years they have been at university, and whether or not they work to support themselves and receive financial support from their parents. Second, we use variables based on survey questions measuring political participation."
