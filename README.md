# PSCI 3200: Global Development: Intermediate Topics in Politics, Policy, and Data

This repo houses the [Quarto][] sources for the PSCI 3200 website. It is largely inspired by [Andrew Heiss's](https://www.andrewheiss.com/) site for his class [Program Evaluation for Public Service](https://github.com/andrewheiss/evalf22.classes.andrewheiss.com) and [Matt Blackwell's](https://mattblackwell.org/) site for his class [Data Science for the Social Sciences ](https://github.com/gov50-f23/gov50-f23.github.io). 

## How to build this site

1. Install [RStudio][] version 2022.07.1 of later since it installs [Quarto][] with it or just download and install [Quarto][] separately. 
2. Open `site.Rproj` in as an RStudio Project.
3. Edit files as needed and hit the "Render" button to preview the changes locally. 
4. Commit changes and push them to GitHub. GitHub Actions will build the site and deploy it to [https://jrspringman.github.io/psci3200-globaldev/](https://jrspringman.github.io/psci3200-globaldev/).
