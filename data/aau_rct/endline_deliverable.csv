There is a volunteer education center called RMSEC, Bale Robe. The students it teaches are from different districts of Bale. It was founded many years ago by university students to help Bale Robe students in the summer (in their free time). So, it went on like this for many years,... After I take 10th matric exam in 2019, I became an active member of this education center, I had many roles in this education center, for example,as a teacher every year except last year (I was in university for the whole summer), as a supervisor, for the last three years as an executive director...
