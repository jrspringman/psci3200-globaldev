## Required Preparation

Before attending the live session, participants should have R and RStudio installed. [Module 2 Week 2.2](https://classroom.google.com/c/NjY0NDg1OTIzNTM4/m/Njk3OTQ0NTcyMDIw/details) included instructions on how to install R and RStudio and provided a basic introduction to these tools. 


## Optional Preparation

I will be using a Quarto file (.qmd) to lead the session. Quarto is a specific type of file in RStudio that integrates code into document production. If you would like to install Quarto, please consult the materials below:
- [Instructions](/assignments/01_quarto.html)
- [Intro to Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html)


## Materials

Before attending the live session, please download the Data and R Code. 

I will be using a Quarto (.qmd) to lead the session. If you are not familiar with quarto, you should download and use the .R file.
