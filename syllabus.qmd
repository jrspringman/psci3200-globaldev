## Course Description and Objectives

Recent years have seen a tremendous growth in the amount of data available and our ability to process it. This raises the exciting possibility that these advances can be used to improve governance and benefit the world's poor. In this course, students will engage with cutting-edge research that deploys new data and contemporary social science research methods and gain hands-on experience analyzing diverse types of data using rigorous research designs and broadly useful computational tools. 

The course will be organized around several timely substantive topics in global development, including democratic backsliding and autocratization, political accountability and citizen engagement, crime and corruption, climate change resilience, and migration. As we explore these topics, students will gain a deeper understanding of the challenges that shape governance and development outcomes and ways that contemporary social science and the development 'industry' seeks to address them. 

At the same time, students will be introduced to data analysis methods, inferential techniques, and computational tools that are useful across a wide range of applications. Specifically, students will deepen their understanding of basic statistical methods common to the social sciences, learn how these methods can be used to make inferences about population characteristics and causal relationships, and prepare documents that contain reproducible data analysis workflows.

At the end of the course you should be able to:

- Evaluate the quality of evidence in the development field
- Think clearly about how data can be used to learn about development and governance challenges
- Use tools for data analysis such as R, RStudio, git, and GitHub
- Produce professional-quality documents that summarize and visualize data

I hope that this course will encourage both passion and measured optimism about the potential for contemporary social science tools to address complex problems affecting less developed countries.


## Course Materials

###  Books
We will use the following books in this class:

We will use [Data Analysis for Social Science: A Friendly and Practical Introduction (DSS)](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691199436/data-analysis-for-social-science) as a jumping-off point for this course. While students are expected to already be familiar with many of the tools and concepts covered this book, it will serve as a method to review core concepts and orient discussion about how to expand on these skills. 

Students are encouraged, but definitely not required, to purchase a personal copy.



### Computing

In the course, we will be using R for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. [R](https://www.r-project.org/foundation/) is free, open source, and available on all major operating systems. We will also be using [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com), which is a free, widely used graphical interface for R. For document preparation, we will be using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that is compatible with both R and Python, as well as several other languages. Both Quarto and RStudio are supported by a company called [Posit](https://posit.co/). For version control, we will be using [Github]{https://github.com/}. 


## Course Structure

Weekly reading assignments will be divided between contemporary research on substantive topics in global development and textbook chapters focused on social science research methods. You are expected to attend class and be prepared to engage in discussion about the assigned readings. Performance in this class will be evaluated by class attendance and participation (10%), short blog posts engaging with the methods or substance of weekly readings (20%), data exercises (30%), and a final project (40%). 



### Expectations

In this course, you will be expected to

- complete eight problem sets,
- complete eight weekly tutorials,
- take two take-home, open-book exams, and
- write one final data analysis project.

### Prerequisites

You should already have R and RStudio installed 

We will also use git and Github to manage our projects. 

This class is also designed as a follow-up to PSCI 1102. Students are encouraged but not required to take that course before this one. Students should be ready to engage with data assignments in the programming language R. This means that students should also have taken PSCI 1800 or an equivalent course. Students that have not taken PSCI 1102 and PSCI 1800 (or an equivalent) should contact the instructor before enrolling. Students more comfortable in Python are welcome, but will receive less instructor support. 


### Exams

There will be two take-home exams during the course. This exam will be similar to a homework in format and in the sense that it will be open book and open internet, but you will not be allowed to collaborate with other students or be able to communicate with any humans about the exam. You will be given several days to complete the exam. We will provide more information about the exam as it approaches. 

| Exam   | Release Date            | Due Date                 |
|:-------|:------------------------|:-------------------------|
| Exam 1 | Thu, Oct 19th 5:00pm ET | Sun, Oct 22nd 11:59pm ET |
| Exam 2 | Thu, Dec 7th 5:00pm ET | Sun, Dec 10th 11:59pm ET |
 

### Grading

You (the student) and I (the instructor) should care the most about what you *learn*, not what numerical/letter summary of that learning you get at the end of the semester. So I would love to not have grades at all, but unfortunately we humans are very good at procrastinating on our good intentions when there is no incentive not to. Thus, we have grades to help solve this commitment problem and to encourage you to put effort into learning the course material. 

Here are how each portion of course contributes to the overall grade:

| Category      | Percent of Final Grade |
|:--------------|:-----------------------|
| R Tutorials   | 10%                    |
| Problem Sets  | 40%                    |
| Exams         | 30%                    |
| Final Project | 20%                    |


**Bump-up policy**: We reserve the right to "bump up" the grades of students who have made valuable contributions to the course in the lecture, sections, study halls, or discussion/Slack. This also applies to students who show tremendous progress and growth over the semester. 






## Final Project



The final project is a data analysis project about whatever data excites you. That could be public opinion in U.S. elections, United Nations voting patterns, patterns of racial discrimination in police behavior, the distribution of salaries in basketball, or the economics of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. No matter the topic, you will formula a key research question, find data on that question, answer the question using the tools of the course, and present those results for public consumption. 

The goal is for this to be a *professional* project that you can use to showcase the skills that you have gained to potential employers. Your final submission will be a publicly available article/website that contains: (1) a brief introduction to the research question and data collected; (2) a visualization of the data in question that speaks to your research question; (3) a presentation (as a table or graph) of a regression model assessing your question along with a plain-English interpretation; (4) a brief (one-paragraph) section that describes limitations of your analysis and threats to inference, and states how your analysis could be improved (e.g., improved data that would be useful to collect). Finally, there must be a link to the GitHub repo that contains the source code to load, clean, and analyze the data and produce the article. 

The data collection and cleaning must be meaningful---it's not sufficient to simply use a pre-cleaned data from an R package. Self-collected data is allowed and even encouraged, though beware that it can only be used for the final project itself only unless you go through [human subjects approval from the University](https://cuhs.harvard.edu/undergraduate-research-and-course-projects).  


| Milestone                    | Due Date                 |

## Course Policies

You will need to bring a personal laptop to class.

### Late Submissions and Regrading

Late submission of assignments will incur a penalty of 2 points deducted for every day late, except in **documented** cases of serious illness or family emergency.

If you feel there has been an error in the grading of one your assignment, you may request in writing a regrade of the assignment. I will regrade the entire assignment, not just the part you are disputing. Therefore, your regrade might increase or decrease the overall grade on the assignment. 


### Use of AI Tools

You are welcome to use generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, to assist you with your work in this course. In the future, we will all be using these tools, so I believe it is important that we gain experience with their use. However, AI tools frequently make errors and 'hallucinate' information about things that do not exist (journal articles, R functions, etc.). It is your responsibility to verify the information provided by such tools. Most importantly, you are required to disclose your use of AI tools for assignments in the form of footnotes or citations. The use of AI tools will not be counted against you. On the contrary, I want to adopt and share your clever or innovative applications of AI tools.

### Academic Honesty

The work that you do in both the problem sets should be your own work. You may seek help from others so long as this does not result in someone else completing your work for you. When asking for help, you may show others your code to help diagnose a bug or highlight a potential issue, but you should not view their (working) code. You should cite any discussions you have with other students in your problem set and note if they helped you with your code. You should never copy and paste code from another student or elsewhere (e.g., websites, former students). 









## Mental Health

Your mental health is important to me. Struggles with mental health, as well as serious mental illnesses, are common across students, faculty, and staff. Please feel free to reach out to me about issues you are having within or outside of this course. I emphatically encourage anyone who thinks they may benefit to utilize the university resources listed below:

* [Counseling and Mental Health Services](https://wellness.upenn.edu/student-health-and-counseling/student-health-and-counseling-counseling)
* [24/7 Services: 215-746-9355](https://wellness.upenn.edu/student-health-and-counseling/student-health-and-counseling-counseling#Drop-In%20Services)

Please note that this list is not comprehensive. If there are services that you think should be added to this list, please let me know.

## Accessibility 

Accessibility is a shared value and a shared responsibility at Penn. The Weingarten Center partners with other departments throughout campus to coordinate and improve the accessibility of buildings and grounds, transportation, communication, and digital infrastructure. Students that require academic accommodations should contact the [Weingarten Center](https://weingartencenter.universitylife.upenn.edu/academic-accommodations/). Academic accommodations are determined on an individualized basis through an interactive process that involves student self-disclosure, documentation of disability, and an initial meeting with a Disability Specialist. Accommodations do not alter fundamental requirements of the course and are not retroactive. Students should request accommodations as early as possible, since they may take time to implement. Students can notify the Weingarten Center at any time during the semester if adjustments to their communicated accommodation plan are needed.
