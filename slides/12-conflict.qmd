  + Think very seriously about the data for your final project
  + Come with questions 
  

## Agenda

\

1. Review of last 3 classes
2. Final Project Assignment
3. Conflict and Cohesion


# Final Project Discussion

## Final Project

- Data analysis project with data of your choosing
  + Formulate a research question
  + Find data that can help you answer that question
  + Apply the tools and methods from this course
  + Write-up analysis
- Produce a webpage to present your results for public consumption 

## Write-up

1. Introduction to research question and data
2. Discussion of research design, assumptions, and threats to inference
3. Visualization describing your data
4. Presentation of results from a regression model and discussion of implications for research question 
5. Discussion of policy implications

## Public Datasets

**[Dataset of datasets](https://github.com/erikgahner/PolData/blob/master/PolData.csv)**

- Ethiopian University Students (n $\approx$ 900)
  + Representative sample
  + Panel survey, networks, open-ended responses
- Ghanaian Radio Stations (n $\approx$ 400)
  + Convenience sample

## Assignment 1

**March 12**

- Send me a quarto html file that:
  + Briefly describes your research question
  + Proposes a dataset and measures that will help you answer it

# Conflict Overview

## Causes of Conflict 

**The puzzle of conflict**

- Fighting is *always* more costly than a negotiated settlement
- Bargains can't always be reached
  + Uncertainty
  + Commitment problems
- Some actors benefit from conflict
  + These actors will often mobilize on intergroup cleavages

# Paluck et al. (2021)

## Types of interventions

**Applied Interventions**

- Anti-bias, multicultural, and moral education
- Diversity Training

## Types of interventions

**Research Interventions**

- Cognitive and emotional training
- Value consistency and self-worth
- Peer influence, discussion, and dialogue
- Social categorization
- Entertainment
- Contact

## Problems with existing research

\

::: {.fragment}
- Treatment intensity
  + Focus on light-touch interventions
- Measurement duration
- Realism and sample selection
- Publication bias
  + Small samples yield bigger effects

:::

  + Sports in Iraq and India
- Interpersonal conversations
  + Conversations in USA
- Workplace diversity training
  + Global corporate environment
- Normative interventions
  + Social sanctioning on Twitter



# Mousa (2020)

## Why Study Cohesion?

\

**What is social cohesion?**

::: {.fragment}
- Patterns of cooperation among individuals from different social groups who live and work in close proximity
:::

## Why Study Cohesion?

\

**Why do we want to increase cohesion?**

::: {.fragment}
- Better governance
  + Adherence to norms and laws
- Sustainable peace
  + Identity as a cleavage
  + Cooperation on peace agreements
:::


## Building social cohesion

**What is the theory?**

::: {.fragment}
- Social contact promots cohesion
  + Cooperation on shared goal
  + Social equality
  + Socially endorsed

:::

::: {.fragment}

**What is the context?**

:::

::: {.fragment}

- Post-war Iraq
- Rigid inter-ethnic cleavages

:::

## Intervention

**What is the intervention?**

::: {.fragment}
- Randomly assigning Christian teams to have three muslim players
:::

::: {.fragment}
**What is the design?**
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Block randomization on baseline perceived commonality
:::


## Outcomes

**Generalizability**

::: {.fragment}
- On-the-field
- Off-the-field
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Domain**
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Behavioral
- Attitudinal
:::

## Outcomes

![](img/mousa_outcomes.png){fig-align="center"}

## Findings

**Main findings**

::: {.fragment}
- Improved behavior towards Muslim teammates
- No improvement in generalizable behavior
- No improvements in attitudes toward Muslims
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Exploratory findings**
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Strong effects among successful teams
- Improved generalizable behaviors across the league
- Improved generalizable attitudes of exposed residents
:::

## Policy Implications

\

::: {.fragment}
- Contact works, but in a narrow way
  + We can improve people's treatment of those they have contact with, but it doesn't generalize
  + This necessarily limits the potential impact
- We can reduce discrimination without attitude change
  + Creating personal ties can facilitate trade, negotiation, etc.

# Grady et al. (2023)

## How contact can promote societal change

**Theory**

::: {.fragment}
- Contact can create *societal* change through social diffusion
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Mechanisms for diffusion**
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Changing norms
- Knowledge of positive contact

:::


## Intervention

::: {.fragment}
**Grant program for conflict-affected villages**

- Mixed-group committees deciding on resource allocation
- Mediation training
- Forums to discuss conflict
- Publicly visible cooperation
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Design**
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Village-level random assignment
:::


## Outcomes

- Contact
  + Self-reported contact
  + Contact willingness experiment
  + Observed behavior
- Perceptions of security
- Attitudes
  + Endorsement experiment
  + Self-reported attitudes
- Cooperative behavioral game

## Findings

## Alternative Explanations

\

- Placebo outcomes
- Bundled treatment


## Policy Implications

- Contact interventions can have wider societal change and reduce the barriers to peace between conflicting groups
- For social diffusion, contact must be highly public


<!-- **Contact Theory** -->

<!-- 1. Equal status -->
<!-- 2. Common goals -->
<!-- 3. Socially sanctioned -->

<!-- - Modal study involves indirect contact (second-hand or imagined) -->
<!-- - Training to reduce prejudiced cognition -->
<!-- - Dialogue -->
<!-- - Direct contact -->
<!-- - Extended and imagined contact -->
