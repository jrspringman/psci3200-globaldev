What can correlations do:
description = comparison [sample matters]
forecasting = sample population -> out-of-sample [sample matters]
causal inference = correlation + research design [sample matters less]



Correlations
* describe the world, forecast future events, 

occurence of features/variables

Slope/ line of best fit
- What is it minimizing?

Correlations rely on comparison
- selecting on the DV
- applies to qualitative work as well
- huge amounts of bad evaluation work does this

Politicians facing scandals tend to face re-election
- what data does this rely on?
- why is this not a correlation: we don't learn if these things tend to happen together
- what would make it a correlation 
- what data would we need to assess: rate of re-election for both scandal and non-scandal politicians




standard deviation
- why avg of squared deviations rather than absolute value?
- implications for interpretation?
- reporting effects as SDs
covariance
correlation coefficient
slope of regression line
