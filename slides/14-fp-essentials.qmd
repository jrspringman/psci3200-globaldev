# Final Project Review

## Research Question

**Does moving to a new city reduce the political engagement of young people?**  

- I hypothesize that moving to a new city will reduce young people's likelihood of engaging in political or civic action
  + Youth have low levels of political engagement, often driven by lack of information and experience
  + Youth that move have less information and experience with engagement in their new city
  + Youth that move probably have fewer social ties, and ties are important for facilitating engagement

## Research Design

- **Design**: Estimate the relationship between *whether or not an individual moved to a new city to attend university* and their *level of political engagement*
- **Assumption**: Individuals that moved to a new city had similar propensities to participate to those that did not, conditional on observable covariates 
- **Diagnosis**: Unrealistic!
- **Plan**: Build confidence by ruling-out potential differences in baseline propensity to participate among moving and non-moving students

## Researh Context

\

- Students at Addis Ababa University (AAU)
  + Youth frequently move to a new city in order to obtain education
  + AAU is Ethiopia's top university, and students from around the country move to study there
  + Universities are important sites of political socialization


## Building Confidence

**Observable implications**

- Identify specific types of participation that are more and less likely to be affected by whether at student moves
  + Some forms of participation rely on social ties or information about the environment, while others do not
- Account for the length of time since respondents moved to their new city
  + As students become more embedded, the gap between moving and non-moving students should become smaller

## Building Confidence

**Conditioning**

- Students that move from one urban place to another urban place
  + Students that move from one city to another city will be less different (in their propensity to participate) than those moving from rural to urban
- Students with similar socio-economic status (SES)
  + Students with similar SES will be less different (in their propensity to participate) than those with similar SES

## Building Confidence

\

**Placebo tests**

- Moving may affect feelings about your individual efficacy, but not the efficacy of youth in general
- Moving may affect your participation recent engagement, but not an opportunity to engage that was provided within the survey


## Data and Variables

**Data**

- Representative survey of 825 AAU students 
- 2 waves (May-June, October-November of 2022)

**Variables**

- Outcome: survey questions measuring political participation
- Treatment: whether student is originally from Addis Ababa
- Building confidence: feelings of political efficacy, number of years since move, urban or rural origin, SES, etc.


# Final Project Essentials

## Creating Index Measures

**When to create an index measure**

- When you have many ways of measuring a single concept
  + This is true for outcome measures, treatment measures, and covariates

**Benefits of index measures**

- Simplifies analysis (fewer graphs, tables, etc.)
- Reduces number of hypotheses being tested


## Additive Scale

**What is an additive scale?**

- Simple sum across columns (index = column_1 + column_2)

**When to use an additive scale**

- When variables are measured on a common scale
- When you are interested in a cumulative amount of something
  + Number of times someone engaged in a specific behavior
  + Amount of money from several different sources

## Additive Scale

\

**Benefits of additive scales**

- Interpretability: number on the original scale
- Simplicity: Just plain addition

## Averaged Z-Scores

**What is a z-score?**

- $Z = (X - \mu) / \sigma$
- Standardized: Mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1

**When to use averaged z-scores**

- When variables are measured on different scales 
- When variables cannot be summed

## Averaged Z-Scores

\

**Benefits of averaged z-scores**

- Interpretability: Standard deviations from the mean
- Outlier detection: abs(3)

## Fancier index techniques

\

- Principal Component Analysis
- Factor Analysis
- Inverse Covariance Weighting


## Interaction Terms

**What is an interaction term?**

- Simple linear models assume that the effect of predictors is independent of other factors 
- Interaction terms allow us to estimate the difference in the slope of a predictor across unit characteristics

$$
Y_i = \alpha + \beta_1 X_{i1} + \beta_2 X_{i2} + \beta_3 X_{i1}*X_{i2} + \epsilon_i
$$

## Interaction Terms

**What are interaction terms used for?**

- Heterogeneous effects
- Difference-in-differences

**Example:** Continuous outcome with two binary predictors

- $\alpha$: Intercept when $X_{i1}$ and $X_{i2}$ are 0
- $\beta_1$ Slope when $X_{i2} = 0$
- $\beta_2$ Difference in $\alpha$ between $X_{i2}=0$ and $X_{i2}=1$
- $\beta_3$ Difference in $\beta_1$ between $X_{i2}=0$ and $X_{i2}=1$
