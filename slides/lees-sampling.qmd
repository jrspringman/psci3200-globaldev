# Inferring Population Characteristics via Survey Research

## Survey Research

::: {.incremental}
- We often want to *describe* a population of interest
  + Ex. What share of the population completed secondary school?
  + 
- We usually can't collect data on the entire population
- Sampling allows us to estimate population characteristics from a *subset* of the population
- Random sampling makes it most likely that our sample is *representative* of the population

One common goal of research is to

## Getting a Representative Samples

::: {.incremental}
- Sampling frame 
  + Comprehensive list of units
  + Ideally: Census, administrative records
  + Developing contexts: create this yourself on-the-ground
- Non-response
  + Selection into sample can bias estimates, induce spurious relationships
  + Think about collider example
:::

## Dealing with Missingness

::: {.incremental}
- Unit non-response
  + Incentives
  + Fancy weighting
- Item non-response
  + Self-administration
- Misreporting
  + List experiments
:::

## Dealing with Missingness

- Always look at NAs immediately
- Always think about how this might bias estimates

## Sampling Strategies

::: {.incremental}
- Probability sampling strategies:
  + Simple random sampling 
  + Stratified sampling
  + Cluster sampling
- Non-Probability sampling strategies:
  + Convenience sample
:::

## Simple Random Sampling

- Each unit within the population has the same probability of being chosen
- As size increases, the sample more closely resemble the population
- Assumes that unit and item non-response are effectively random


## Stratified sampling

::: {.incremental}
- Divide the entire population into *homogeneous* strata
- Take random samples from each stratum
  + Decreases risk of imbalance
  + Ex. Race, gender, partisanship
- Oversampling
  + Allows for more precise estimates of small group characteristics
  + Must adjust for population estimates
:::

## Cluster sampling

::: {.incremental}
- Divide population into *heterogeneous* clusters 
- Take random sample of clusters
  + Decreases costs of sampling
  + Ex. Districts, schools, businesses
