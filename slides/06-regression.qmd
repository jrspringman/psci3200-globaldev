# Survey Experiments

## What are survey experiments?

\

::: {.fragment}
**Two general uses**

::: {.incremental}
- Measuring sensitive attitudes
  + Providing anonymity
- Identifying causal effect
  + Manipulating images and text
:::
:::


## List Experiments

::: {.incremental}
- What can list experiments tell us?
  + prevalence of the sensitive attitude in the survey population
- What can they *not* tell us
  + attitude of any individual respondent
- When might this be useful?
  + Assessing prevalence of something
  + Quantifying measurement bias/misreporting
:::

## List Experiments

::: {.r-stack}

![](img/list_exp_qualtrics.png){.fragment width=150% fig-align="center"}

![](img/list_experiment.png){.fragment width=60% fig-align="center"}
:::

## Randomized Response

::: {.incremental}
- What is it?
  + Induce some $p > 0$ that you say "Yes" even if you disagree
- Pitfalls
  + Complexity, confusion 
  + Lack of anonymity
- Variants
  + Repeated randomized response
  + Crosswise
:::


## Priming

::: {.incremental}
- What is it?
  + Measures *implicit* attitudes by stimulating unconscious association
- Pitfalls
  + Hard to know if the prime worked (false negative, confounding, etc.)
:::

::: {.notes}
Confounding: Any experimental intervention A that is meant to trigger mental construct M could also trigger mental construct C. If C is not varied in the experimental design, researchers cannot determine whether M, C, or a combination of M and C affect outcomes of interest.
:::

## Vignettes and Factorials

::: {.incremental}
- What is it?
  + Presents a scenario while varying key components
- Pitfalls
  + Unrealistic combinations
  + Limited power
:::


## Conjoints

::: {.incremental}
- What is it?
  + Presents pair of profiles while varying attributes
  + Asks respondents to choose between profiles
- Pitfalls
  + Requires careful attention
  + Can be highly synthetic
:::

## Credibility in Survey Experiments

::: {.fragment}
::: {.incremental}
- Multiple Hypothesis Testing
- Pre-registration
- Behavioral measures
:::
:::

# Albertus & Grossman

## Background

**Decline in the quantity and quality of democracies**

::: {.fragment}
- Executive power grabs rather than military coups
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Common tools used**

::: {.incremental}
1. Weaken judiciary and media independence 
2. Purge bureaucracy and neutralize legislature
3. Reduce political competition through legal changes
:::
:::

## Research Questions

\

::: {.fragment}
::: {.incremental}
1. Why do many voters support or ignore antidemocratic actions? 
2. Why are transgressions rarely punished? 
3. How is public opinion affected by means and justification?
:::
:::

## Why don't citizens resist?

**Three potential answers:**

::: {.fragment}
::: {.incremental}
- Citizens don't realize executive's intentions
  + Should identify and oppose
- Citizens are conditional democrats (trade-off w/ideology)
  + Should identify and support conditional on ideology
- Citizens may have differing conceptions of democracy
  + Don't identify actions as antidemocratic
:::
:::

## What's the Research Design?

::: {.fragment}
**Vignette Experiment**

::: {.incremental}
- Manipulation
  + Antidemocratic behavior
  + Partisan alignment
  + Means and justifications
- Outcomes
  + Perceived as antidemocratic
  + Support for action
  + Support for punishment
:::
:::

## Findings

::: {.fragment}
::: {.incremental}
- Positive: 
  + Citizens identify antidemocratic actions
  + Respondents identify actions and oppose them
  + Means and justifications do not increase support
- Negative
  + Significant minority supports antidemocratic actions
  + Partisan power increases support (is this weird?)
  + Little support for legal punishment
:::
:::

## Editorial Notes

\

Pushes back against polarization based explanations, which predict that people *support* antidemocratic behaviors because they view the other side as so dangerous


## Policy Implications?

\

::: {.fragment}
::: {.incremental}
- Legal punishment might cause backlash
- Encoding norms into law might not matter
- Reducing polarization might not help
:::
:::


# Hollerbauer et al. (working paper)

## Background

**Governments seek to control NGO activities**

::: {.incremental}
- NGOs control significant development resources 
- They engage in activity that benefits and threatens incumbents
- Governments respond with both accommodation and coercion
:::

## Research Questions

How do government interventions affect NGO behavior?

::: {.fragment}
::: {.incremental}
1. Where NGOs work
2. How they operate
3. Who they engage with
:::
:::

## What's the Research Design?

::: {.fragment}
**Conjoint Experiment**

::: {.incremental}
- Manipulation: subnational variation in...
  + Positive or negative government intervention
  + Cooptation vs equal treatment of NGOs
  + Positive vs negative rhetoric about NGOs
- Outcomes: community where NGO would...
  + Prefer to work
  + Involve the public
  + Partner with other actors (NGOs, govt, community leaders)
  + Organize public action
:::

## Attribute Table

![](img/hlr_table.png){fig-align="center"}

## Question Appearance

![](img/hlr_qultr.png){fig-align="center"}



## Findings

::: {.fragment}
::: {.incremental}
- Negative
  + NGOs avoid repression and cooptation
  + NGOs reduce partnership and public engagement 
- Positive
  + Repression increases public action
:::
:::


## Policy Implications?

\

::: {.fragment}
::: {.incremental}
- Governments can shape where NGOs work
- Networks aren't the answer
- Facilitating contentious action may increase the cost of repression
:::
:::

# Linear Regression

## Predicting Outcomes

**Why make predictions?**

::: {.fragment}
::: {.incremental}
- Data coverage
- Strategic planning
:::
:::

::: {.fragment}
**How does prediction work?**
:::

::: {.fragment}
::: {.incremental}
- Mapping relationships between past and future or between measured and unmeasured units
- Agnostic out causality (what are the implications?)
:::
:::

## Linear Regression Model

\

$$
Y_i = \alpha + \beta X_i + \epsilon_i
$$


::: {.fragment}
::: {.incremental}
- What is $\alpha$?
- What is $\beta$?
- What is $X_i$?
- What is $\epsilon_i$?
:::
:::

## Linear Regression Model

**Estimating model parameters**

$$
\hat{Y_i} = \hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta} X_i
$$
**Residuals**

$$
\hat{\epsilon_i} = Y_i - \hat{Y_i}
$$

## Linear Regression Model


**Coefficient**
$$
\hat{\beta} = \Delta{\hat{Y}} / \Delta{X}
$$

**Minimizing Residuals**

$$
SSR = \sum_{i}^{N} \hat{\epsilon}_i^2
$$
