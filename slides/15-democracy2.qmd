2. Final Project Essentials: Interaction terms

# Varieties of Democracy

## Polyarchy (Dahl, 1972)

\

**Polyarchy is about the degree of political competition**

- Democracy is an ideal too tough to define
- Instead, he describes procedures that make countries more/less democratic
- Contestation and inclusiveness allow for competition over power
- Competition makes governments accountable to citizens

## Benefits of Democracy

\

**Causal effects of regime-type are difficult, but...**

- Higher economic growth
- Lower poverty (famines)
- Fewer international conflicts 


## Waves of Democracy

![](img/pic_vdem_grafik_autokrat-kopie.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Varieties of Democracy

- Governance characteristics scored based on expert opinion
- 25 country experts (2/3 local and 1/3 foreign)
- 500+ indicators
- Sophisticated methods of aggregating into indices and estimating uncertainty across coders
- Liberal Democracy, Electoral Democracy, Electoral Autocracy, Autocracy

## How is governance changing?

\
**Most deterioration seen on:**

::: {.fragment}
1. Freedom of expression
2. Clean elections
3. Freedom of association

## How is governance changing?

\

**Broad trends**

::: {.fragment}

- Number of people living under autocracy back to 1985 levels
- Concentration of global power is shifting (BRICS+ vs G7)
- 60 countries are holding national elections this year
  + 31 worsening; 3 improving

# Garcia-Ponce and Wantchekon


## Why countries Democratize

- Correlation between income and democracy
  + Modernization theory: wealth, education, and urbanization are associated with democratization
- Why might this be true?


::: {.fragment}
*In Africa, democratization after the Cold War was shaped by the level of development (urbanization) at the start of countries' anti-colonial movements*
:::

## Context

\

- Anti-colonial movements chose between two strategies:
  + Rural insurgency
  + Urban protest
- Democratization was delayed by the Cold War

::: {.fragment}
1. *What shaped opposition movements' choice between strategies?*
2. *What delayed democratization during the Cold War?*
:::

## Theory


**Why does opposition strategy affect democratization decades later?**

::: {.fragment}

- Inclusion
- Organization

:::

::: {.fragment}

**Mechanisms:**

- Institutions
- Behaviors

:::

## Findings

## Threats to inference

- Things that affect whether or not opposition uses insurgency vs protest might also affect current levels of democracy

```{r edu-ex-simple, echo=FALSE, fig.width=9, fig.height=4.5, out.width="100%"}

                        y = c(Strategy = 2, Democracy = 2, U1 = 4, Terrain = 4))

```


## Identification

- Covariates
- Sensitivity analysis
- Difference-in-Differences
  + Leverages changes within countries over time
  + Before the end of the cold war, groups look similar
  + After the end of the cold war, groups trend away from each other
- Instrumental Variables
  + Leverages 'plausibly exogeneous' variation in terrain 
  + Terrain predicts strategy choice

## Instrumental Variable

```{r edu-terrain-simple, echo=FALSE, fig.width=9, fig.height=4.5, out.width="100%"}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggdag)

dagify(
  Democracy ~ Strategy  + U1,
  Strategy ~ U1,
  Strategy ~ Terrain,
  exposure = "Strategy",
  outcome = "Democracy",
  latent = "U1",
  labels = c("Strategy" = "Post-WWII\nStrategy", "Democracy" = "Post-1990\nDemocracy",
             "U1" = "Unobserved stuff", "Terrain" = "Terrain"),
  coords = edu_ex_coords) |> 
  tidy_dagitty() |> 
  node_status() |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend)) +
  geom_dag_edges() +
  geom_dag_point(aes(color = status), size = 14) +
  geom_dag_text(aes(label = label), color = "black", size = 5) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#FF4136", "grey60", "#0074D9"),
                     na.value = "#7FDBFF") +
  guides(color = "none") +
  theme_dag()

```


## Mechanisms: Institutions

**We do not seen an impact of Post-WWII Opposition Strategy on Post-1990 Institutions**

## Mechanisms: Behavior

## Policy Implications

\

- Historical social movements help understand the link between structural conditions and democratic development
- Non-violent collective action appears critical for the establishment of lasting democracy
- 

# Final Project Essentials

## Interaction Terms

**What is an interaction term?**

- Simple linear models assume that the effect of predictors is independent of other factors 
- Interaction terms allow us to estimate the difference in the slope of a predictor across unit characteristics

$$
Y_i = \alpha + \beta_1 X_{i1} + \beta_2 X_{i2} + \beta_3 X_{i1}*X_{i2} + \epsilon_i
$$

## Interaction Terms

**What are interaction terms used for?**

- Heterogeneous effects
- Difference-in-differences

**Example:** Continuous outcome with two binary predictors

- $\alpha$: Intercept when $X_{i1}$ and $X_{i2}$ are 0
- $\beta_1$ Slope when $X_{i2} = 0$
- $\beta_2$ Difference in $\alpha$ between $X_{i2}=0$ and $X_{i2}=1$
- $\beta_3$ Difference in $\beta_1$ between $X_{i2}=0$ and $X_{i2}=1$
