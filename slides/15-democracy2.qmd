2. Final Project Essentials: Interaction terms

# Varieties of Democracy

## Polyarchy (Dahl, 1972)

**Polyarchy is about the degree of political competition**

- Democracy is an ideal too tough to define
- Instead, he offers descriptions of what makes countries more/less democratic
- Contestation and inclusiveness make governments accountable to citizens

## Benefits of Democracy

**Causal effects of democracy are difficult, but...***

- Higher economic growth
- Lower poverty (famines)
- Fewer international conflicts 

## Waves of Democracy

## Varieties of Democracy

**Premier measure of regime-types over time and space**

- Governance characteristics scored based on expert opinion.
- 25 country experts (2/3 local and 1/3 foreign)
- 500+ indicators
- Sophisticated methods of aggregating into indices and estimating uncertainty across coders
- Liberal Democracy, Electoral Democracy, Electoral Autocracy, Autocracy

## How is governance changing?

\

1. Freedom of expression
2. Clean elections
3. Freedom of association

## How is governance changing?

- More people living under autocracy (1985 levels)
- Concentration of global power is shifting (BRICS+)
- 60 countries are holding national elections this year (31 worsening; 3 improving)

## Interaction Terms

**What is an interaction term?**

- Simple linear models assume that the effect of predictors is independent of other factors 
- Interaction terms allow us to estimate the difference in the slope of a predictor across unit characteristics

$$
Y_i = \alpha + \beta_1 X_{i1} + \beta_2 X_{i2} + \beta_3 X_{i1}*X_{i2} + \epsilon_i
$$

## Interaction Terms

**What are interaction terms used for?**

- Heterogeneous effects
- Difference-in-differences

**Example:** Continuous outcome with two binary predictors

- $\alpha$: Intercept when $X_{i1}$ and $X_{i2}$ are 0
- $\beta_1$ Slope when $X_{i2} = 0$
- $\beta_2$ Difference in $\alpha$ between $X_{i2}=0$ and $X_{i2}=1$
- $\beta_3$ Difference in $\beta_1$ between $X_{i2}=0$ and $X_{i2}=1$
