# Finishing up interaction terms

## Interaction Terms

$$
Y_i = \alpha + \beta_1 X_{i1} + \beta_2 X_{i2} + \beta_3 X_{i1}*X_{i2} + \epsilon_i
$$

**Example:** Continuous outcome with two binary predictors

::: {.incremental}
- $\alpha$: [Intercept when $X_{i1}$ and $X_{i2}$ are 0]{.fragment}
- $\beta_1$: [Slope when $X_{i2} = 0$]{.fragment}
- $\beta_2$: [Difference in $\alpha$ between $X_{i2}=0$ and $X_{i2}=1$]{.fragment}
- $\beta_3$: [Difference in $\beta_1$ between $X_{i2}=0$ and $X_{i2}=1$]{.fragment}

## Debates Around Aid

- Economic growth
- Welfare
- State capacity
- Poverty alleviation
- Accountability

## Debates Around Aid

- Budget support vs Project Aid
  + Governments have information advantages
  + Government budgets are subject to massive leakage (Reinikka & Svensson, 2004)
- Accountability
  + Fungibility
  + Donor vs recipient control


## Aid Distribution

![](img/aid_bypass.png){fig-align="center"}


# Briggs (2016)

## Research Question

\

**Is development aid targeted to the poorest citizens?**

:::{.incremental}
- Donors have a stated preference for using aid to alleviate extreme poverty
- Pressure may undermine this targeting
  + Donor foreign policy objectives
  + Donor ignorance
  + Recipient politics
:::

## Theory

\

**Why is it easier for multilateral donors to send aid to poorer countries?**

:::{.incremental}
- Multiple stakeholders mean aid must flow to places where preferences overlap
- Donor preferences are likely to overlap in the places with the greatest need
:::


## Case Selection

**Most likely scenario for effective targeting:**

:::{.fragment}
- Commitments rather than disbursements
- Multilateral donors 
- Project aid
:::

:::{.fragment}
**Project aid must be proximate**

- Aid is typically providing local public goods
:::


## Measurement

- DV: Aid projects per region
  + World Bank and ADB 2009-2010
  + Each region's share (with and without cost weights)
  + Total dollar value
- IV: Wealth quintiles
  + DHS 1999-2008
  + Relative wealth composition of each region (% of each quintile living in each region)

## Research Design

\

:::{.fragment}
- Unit Fixed Effects
- Lagged IV  $\rightarrow$ DV
- Control for obvious pre-treatment confounders
- What is his "most likely" design?
- Does he "identify" causal effects?

## Policy Implications

- Majority of people live in middle-income countries, but is that where we should send aid?


# Briggs (2021)

## Research Design

**Conjoint survey experiment**

- Sample: World Bank Task Team Leaders
- Task: select projects based on important characteristics
- Outcomes: Client desirability, WB approval, implementation, impact


## Research Question

**What pressures shape the distribution of aid?**

:::{.fragment}
- Which projects the client government would prefer
- Which projects would be easier to get WB approval
- Which projects would be easier to implement
- Which projects would get better internal ratings
- Which project would be better for development

## Findings

## Findings

![](img/briggs6.png){fig-align="center"}

## Findings

**Client government desireability**

- Positive: Hometown of the recipient countryâ€™s President
- Positive: Government implemented
- Neutral: Income of project location, urban

**Ease of approval**

- Positive: poorer places was easier to get approved
- Negative: presidential hometowns
- Negative: projects with smaller budgets

## Findings

**Development impact**

- Positive: Poorer and rural areas 

**Ease of implementation**

- Negative: Poorer and remote projects
- *Getting more projects approved was either extremely or very important to their career*
