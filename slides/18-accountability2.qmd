## Models of political accountability

**What is political accountability?**

- Accountability is meant to produce *responsiveness*
- Responsiveness means that a government "adopts policies that are signaled as preferred by citizens" (Manin, 1999)
- If governments fail to adopt citizens' preferred policies, they will be sanctioned


::: {.fragment}
**Assumptions**
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Politicians have information about what citizens want
- Citizens have information about which policies a politician is responsible for
:::

## Models of political accountability

**Accountability requires that Voters:**

- Observe credible signal of performance
  + Attribution
  + Benchmarking
- Update their beliefs
- Have credible alternatives

## Models of political accountability

\

**Accountability requires that politicians:**

- Seek to maintain office
- Observe citizen preferences
- Update their beliefs

## Models of political accountability

**Distributional politics**

- Target public spending to maximize electoral advantage

**Responsiveness**

- Maximizing welfare across constituents

**Decentalization**

- Both sides have better information at a more local level

## Theory

- Politicians aim to allocate to the community with the highest return on votes
- This means that allocation is conditional on information about citizen preferences across eligible communities

**Citizen utility**: $x_i = c_i(a) - p_i - d_i$

- $c_i(a)$: Utility from investment $a$
- $p_i$: Utility of voting for a challenger
- $d_i$: Cost of voting


## Theory

**Politician utility:**

$$
v_j(a) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} 1(x_i > 0, p_i + d_i \geq 0)
$$
To allocate on electoral rewards, they need to know:

- $c_i(a)$: Utility from investment $a$
- $p_i$: Utility of voting for a challenger
- $d_i$: Cost of voting
- $n$: The number of individuals
:::

## Theory

**Gathering information is costly**

- Time
- Coordination
- Varies across constituencies (geography, social proximity)

**Alternatives**

- Rely on heuristics
- Collect information from more accessible places

## Theory

\

**By providing information to politicians, we can see how the lack of information affects allocation decisions**


## Research Design

**Information about schools**

- Need: Class size, teacher housing, etc.
  + Target communities with high consumption utilities ($c_i(a)$)
- Aid: Existing aid projects at each school
  + Marginal returns to overlapping investments 
- Voting: Vote share at nearest polling station
  + Update on $\bar{p_j}$
  + $d$ determines whether to mobilize swing or base

**Outcome**

- Allocation of NGO supplies

**Heterogeneous effects**

- Transparency
- Information costs

## Research Design

**Questions**

:::{.incremental}
- What do they mean by 'factorial assignment'?
  + Each respondent has 1-3 pieces of information
- In the estimation, how are they using interaction terms?
  + Estimate the impact of information based on provision
  + Estimate heterogeneous effects based on information costs and transparency

$$
P(Y_{nsi} = 1) = \phi(\beta_1z_i + \beta_2t_sz_i + \gamma X_is + e_{nsi})
