# Logistics

## Assignments

- Today
  + 3 readings
  + Ensure Quarto is installed
- Thursday 
  + Create a git repo for this class (psci3200_yourname)
  + DSS Ch4

## Agenda

1. Finishing up Final Project
2. RStudio and Quarto
3. Survey Experiments
    i) Overview
    ii) Albertus & Grossman
    iii) Hollerbauer et al.

# Final Project

## Examples of research questions

- Do citizens with mobile internet access have more negative opinions about their government?
- Do citizens that migrate have more or less positive views about democracy?
- Are domestic media outlets less likely to report on political events after elections?

# RStudio and Quarto

## Poll

::: {.incremental}
- Mac vs Windows vs Other?
- Quarto running?
:::

## Instructions

- Follow-along as I create a quarto page
- Submit the html for the page to me via Slack *before* the end of class

# Survey Experiments

## What are survey experiments?

\

::: {.fragment}
**Two general uses**

::: {.incremental}
- Measuring sensitive attitudes
  + Providing anonymity
- Identifying causal effect
  + Manipulating images and text
:::
:::


## List Experiments

::: {.incremental}
- What can list experiments tell us?
  + prevalence of the sensitive attitude in her survey population
- What can they *not* tell us
  + attitude of any individual respondent
- When might this be useful?
  + Assessing prevalence of something
  + Quantifying measurement bias/misreporting
:::

## List Experiments

::: {.r-stack}

![](img/list_exp_qualtrics.png){.fragment width=150% fig-align="center"}

![](img/list_experiment.png){.fragment width=60% fig-align="center"}
:::

## Randomized Response

::: {.incremental}
- What is it?
  + Induce some $p > 0$ that you say "Yes" even if you disagree
- Pitfalls
  + Complexity, confusion 
  + Lack of anonymity
- Variants
  + Repeated randomized response
  + Crosswise
:::


## Priming

::: {.incremental}
- What is it?
  + Measures *implicit* attitudes by stimulating unconscious association
- Pitfalls
  + Hard to know if the prime worked (false negative, confounding, etc.)
- Variants
  + Repeated randomized response
  + Crosswise
:::

::: {.notes}
Confounding: Any experimental intervention A that is meant to trigger mental construct M could also trigger mental construct C. If C is not varied in the experimental design, researchers cannot determine whether M, C, or a combination of M and C affect outcomes of interest.
:::

## Vignettes and Factorials

::: {.incremental}
- What is it?
  + Presents a scenario while varying key components
- Pitfalls
  + Unrealistic combinations
  + Limited power
:::


## Conjoints

::: {.incremental}
- What is it?
  + Presents pair of profiles while varying attributes
  + Asks respondents to choose between profiles
- Pitfalls
  + Requires careful attention
  + Can be highly synthetic
:::


# Albertus & Grossman

## Background

**Decline in the quantity and quality of democracies**

- Executive power grabs rather than coups

::: {.fragment}
::: {.incremental}
1. Weaken judiciary and media independence 
2. Purge bureaucracy and neutralize legislature
3. Reduce political competition through legal changes
:::
:::

## Research Questions

::: {.fragment}
::: {.incremental}
1. Why do many voters support or ignore antidemocratic actions? 
2. Why are transgressions rarely punished? 
3. How is public opinion affected by means and justification?
:::
:::

## Research Question

**Why don't citizens resist?**

::: {.fragment}
::: {.incremental}
- Citizens don't realize
  + Should identify and oppose
- Citizens are conditional democrats (trade-off w/ideology)
  + Should identify and support conditional on ideology
- Citizens may have differing conceptions of democracy
  + Don't identify as antidemocratic
:::
:::

## What's the Research Design?

::: {.fragment}
**Vignette Experiment**

::: {.incremental}
- Manipulation
  + Antidemocratic behavior
  + Partisan alignment
  + Means and justifications
- Outcomes
  + Perceived as antidemocratic
  + Support for action
  + Support for punishment
:::
:::

## Findings

::: {.fragment}
::: {.incremental}
- Positive
  + Respondents identify antidemocratic actions and oppose them
  + Means and justifications do not increase support
- Negative
  + Significant minority supports antidemocratic actions
  + Partisan power increases support
:::
:::

## Editorial Notes

\

Pushes back against polarization based explanations, which predict that people *support* antidemocratic behaviors because they view the other side as so dangerous


## Policy Implications?

::: {.fragment}
::: {.incremental}
- Normalize punishment
- Emphasize long-run risks
:::
