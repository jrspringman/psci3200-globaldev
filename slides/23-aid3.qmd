## Health

- HIV: 20.6 million people (600k children) no longer receiving treatment
- Tuberculosis: 10.6 million cases and 2.2 million deaths will not be prevented 
- Nutrition: HKI has stopped a programme that provides nutrition for 5.6 million children
- Nutrition: In Sudan, ~80% of emergency food kitchens are closed
- Nutrition: In Ethiopia, foods to treat ~1 million severely malnourished children will run out by May

severe acute malnutrition: cut off treatment for 2.3 million children in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This would lead to 369,000 extra child deaths a year that would otherwise have been prevented.

 The World Bank estimates that every $1 invested in tackling undernutrition returns $23 in value in terms of child survival, human capital development and economic prosperity
