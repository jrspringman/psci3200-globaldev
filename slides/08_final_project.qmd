# Final Project Overview

## Objectives

*The final project is the culmination of this course*

- Reflect the substantive knowledge and technical skills that you developed
- Provide experience
  + Generating a research question
  + Refining into a testable hypothesis
  + Identifying data to provide evidence for or against
  + Communicating the results of your analysis to others

## Objectives

- Help you answer research questions in the future
- Assess the strength of evidence presented by others
- Incorporate research into your professional decision-making

## Requirements

- Research project with data of your choosing
  + Formulate a research question
  + Find data that can help you answer that question
  + Apply the tools and methods from this course
  + Write-up analysis
- Produce a webpage to present your results for public consumption 

## Write-up

1. Introduction to research question and data
2. Discussion of research design, assumptions, and threats to inference
3. Visualization describing your data
4. Presentation of results from a regression model and discussion of implications for research question 
5. Robustness test to probe assumptions or empirical extension
6. Discussion of policy implications
7. Appendix including supplementary materials

## Assignment 1: Research Question and Data

**Must be submitted via Slack by 11:59pm EST on Monday, February 19**

- Sketch a research question that you'd like to investigate
- Identify data that can answer that question
- I will provide feedback on the viability of the questions, the suitability of the data, and the extent to which your general idea will meet my expectations for the final project
*Send me a quarto html file that:*

- Briefly describes your idea for a research question
  + This should be at least 3-4 sentences describing some relationship in the world that you want to investigate. This should involve at least two things in the world that can be measured with existing quantitative data.
  + You are welcome to submit more than 1 idea. 
- Proposes a dataset and measures that will help you answer it
  + This should include a specific, existing dataset that you can access
  + This should also include mention of the specific variables within that dataset that will be used to answer the research question


## Types of data

There are many types of data in the world. Below is a brief discussion of the most common sources of data in the social sciences. 

- Election returns
  + Compilations of election data, such as [Constituency-Level Elections Archive (CLEA)](https://electiondataarchive.org/)
  + Returns for specific elections are often available from a country's electoral commission website
- Replication data
  + Any published research from the last 5-10 years should make the data and analysis files publicly available. You can almost always find where these replication materials are hosted on the article's webpage at whichever journal puslished the article. Oftentimes, these data are hosted on Harvard's Dataverse.

## Types of data

- Survey data
  + Survey data is used extremely heavily on the social sciences. Most prominently in political science are the various 'barometer' surveys (Afrobarometer, Latinobarometer, etc.).
- Administrative data
  + Data on government (or organization) programs or 
- Expert-coded data
  + Data where experts code the characteristics of countries or political entities (such as parties) 


## Popular Public Datasets

  + This data captures the volume of reporting from high-quality, local news sources on 42 distinct political events from 2012-2023 for 60 aid-receiving countries. 
  + Focuses on events that constitute changes in civic space, such as censorship, legal changes, and other forms of repression
- Cambodian NGOs (n $\approx$ 100)
  + Convenience sample
  + Panel survey, financial data, networks, open-ended responses
- Ethiopian University Students (n $\approx$ 900)
  + Representative sample
