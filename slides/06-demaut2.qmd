## Agenda

## Democracy and Development

What is this plot showing?

## Two explanations

1.  Causal

2.  Correlational

## Development causes democracy

## Modernization Theory

## Democracy Spurs Development

## Democracy and Development in Research

The theoretical links btw democracy and development have permeated micro-development research

Resource booms and democracy - Windfalls do not improve democratic quality but might make autocracies sturdier

Corruption and Development - - Horizontal accountability random audits of Brazilian majors reduce reelection of corrupt politicians

Female participation and development - Looks at random gender quotas in India. Having a female local politician improves development outcomes for female

Democratic quality and deforestation - Democratic competition increases deforestation!

All these literatures borrow from modernization theory

## Acemoglu et. al. 2008

The criticism: correlation of democracy and development does not mean causation

Alternative: Countries embark on divergent development paths

Empirical implication: Observed association is correlational

## Which is the correct DAG?

![](img/modernizationDAG.png)

## How to decide?

We need to control for U

Impossible

We can control for everything

## Simpson Paradox

## ![](img/simpson.webp)

## Fixed effects

Simple idea: control for "belonging to a group" using group-level Fixed Effects

-   A way to control for *every* unobserved group characteristic that ***does not change***

-   In practice: give an intercept to each group

## Fixed effects

Go from

```{=tex}
\begin{equation*}
Democracy_{it} = \alpha + \beta_1 Democracy_{it} + \epsilon_{it}
\end{equation*}
```
To

```{=tex}
\begin{equation*}
Democracy_{it} = \alpha + \beta_1 Democracy_{it} + \mu_1 USA +  \mu_2 France + ... \mu_n Zimbabwe + \epsilon_{it}
\end{equation*}
```
## Fixed effects: Empirical example

```{r rep, include=T, message=F, error=F, echo = T}
pacman::p_load(readxl, tidyverse,  here, estimatr)

d <- read_xls(here("./slides/code/Income-and-Democracy-Data-AER-adjustment.xls"), sheet = 2) %>% 
  filter(is.na(lrgdpch)==F, 
         is.na(polity4)==F) %>% 
  arrange(country, year) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  mutate(lag_dem = lag(polity4), 
         lag_income = lag(lrgdpch)) %>% 
  ungroup()
# Polity2 Index
summary(d$polity4)
# Log real GDP per capita (PWT)
summary(d$lrgdpch)

```

## Fixed effects: Empirical example

```{r rep2, include=T, message=F, error=F, echo = T}

ggplot(d, aes(y = polity4, x = lag_income)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se=F)

```

## Fixed effects: Empirical example

```{r rep3, include=T, message=F, error=F, echo = T}

mod <- lm_robust(polity4~lag_dem + lag_income, clusters = country, data = d)
modelsummary::modelsummary(mod, stars = T, coef_omit = "(Intercept)",  gof_omit = "AIC|BIC|Log.Lik|F|R2")
```

## Add Fixed Effects

```{r rep4, include=T, message=F, error=F, echo = F, centering = T}

cty <- c("Australia", "Nigeria", "Nicaragua", "China", "France", "Indonesia", "Russia")

tempo <- d %>% ungroup() %>% dplyr::filter(country %in% cty)

ggplot(tempo,
       aes(y = polity4, x = lrgdpch, color = country)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se=F) 
```

## Add Fixed Effects

```{r rep5, include=T, message=F, error=F, echo = T}
require(estimatr)
mod2 <- lm_robust(polity4~lag_dem + lag_income, fixed_effects = country + year, clusters = country, data = d)

modelsummary::modelsummary(mod2, stars = T, coef_omit = "(Intercept)",  gof_omit = "AIC|BIC|Log.Lik|F|R2")

```

## Summing up 

- Good theoretical reasons to think 

    - Democracy is causally related to devel

- Most extant work focuses on the micro, subnational dynamics

- But the broad theoretical argument is old!

- Fixed effects can help control for **time invariant** unobserved confounders

- If we think confounders might change in time, for exampe
