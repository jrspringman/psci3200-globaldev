## Agenda

-   Democracy as a consequence of development
-   Democracy as a cause of development
-   Fixed effects

## Democracy and Development

![From Acemoglu et. al. 2008](img/income_dem.png){fig-align="center"}

## Two explanations

::: incremental
1.  Direct causal link

    -   Development $\rightarrow$ democracy
    -   Democracy $\rightarrow$ development

2.  Indirect link or correlation

    -   Income $\rightarrow$ regime survival
    -   Omitted variable

# Development as cause

## Modernization Theory, Lipset (1960)

**Development causes democracy**

::: incremental
-   Economic development requires investing in education, infrastructure, urbanization...

    -   Modernizing.

-   Modernization triggers changes making democracy more likely

    -   Society becomes more complex and organized
    -   Education facilitates democratic citizenship
    -   Infrastructure and urbanization facilitate political competition
:::

## The Threat of Revolution

::: incremental
-   [Acemoglu and Robinson (2001)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.4.938)
-   Rich elites control autocratic societies
    -   But they fear revolution!
-   How to prevent it?
    -   Democratize and redistribute some of the resources
-   Elites and non-elites are better off
:::

# Development as consequence

## Democracy Spurs Development

Dictatorship, Democracy, and Development [(Olson, 1993)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2938736?seq=5)

::: incremental
-   Autocrats want a wealthy country.

-   Why would citizens produce wealth if it can be expropriated by an autocrat?

    -   Solution: **Credibly** tie your own hands with democratic institutions

-   By sharing political power and enshrining property rights, create incentives to produce wealth

-   Democracy $\rightarrow$ development
:::

# Other Explanations

## Democratic Survival

::: incremental
-   Democracy is established independently of development ...

-   But development helps democracies survive

-   "The more well-to-do a nation, the greater the chances it will sustain democracy" (Lipset, 1959)

-   Empirical implications: There will be a correlation btw democracy and development even if development does not cause democracy!

## Democracy and Development in Research

- Are the theoretical arguments for $Democracy \rightarrow Development$ convincing?

## Democracy and Development in Research 

- [Paglayan, 2020](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/nondemocratic-roots-of-mass-education-evidence-from-200-years/8C8C594AA07996A00ED4BEFC66B133B7) 

    - Reconsiders whether democratization increases the provision of education. Finds that democratization *can* increase education provision, but that education is also a powerful for autocrats

    - Electronic voting in Brazil reduced mistakes when voting from poorest, resulting in better accountability and more spending in health care

    -   Random audits of Brazilian majors reduces the chances that corrupt politicians are re-elected

    -   Democratic competition increases deforestation!

## Acemoglu et. al. 2008

-   The criticism: correlation of democracy and development does not mean causation

-   Alternative: Countries embark on divergent development paths

-   Empirical implication: Observed association is correlational

## Which is the correct DAG?

![](img/modernizationDAG.png)

## Empirical Tests

-   We cannot randomize development!

-   We need to control for U

- Is this possible?

::: incremental

- ... if we are willing to add some assumptions

## Simpson Paradox

## Democracy and Development: Empirical example

```{r rep, include=T, message=F, error=F, echo = T, tidy=TRUE}
pacman::p_load(readxl, tidyverse,  here, estimatr)

d <- read_xls(here("./slides/code/Income-and-Democracy-Data-AER-adjustment.xls"), sheet = 2) %>% 
  filter(is.na(lrgdpch)==F, 
         is.na(polity4)==F) %>% 
  arrange(country, year) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  mutate(lag_dem = lag(polity4), 
         lag_income = lag(lrgdpch)) %>% 
  ungroup()
# Polity2 Index
summary(d$polity4)
# Log real GDP per capita (PWT)
summary(d$lrgdpch)
```

## Correlation

```{r rep2, include=T, message=F, error=F, echo = T, tidy=T, centering = T}

ggplot(d, aes(y = polity4, x = lag_income)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se=F)

```


## By country

```{r rep4, include=T, message=F, error=F, echo = F, centering = T, tidy=TRUE}
cty <- c("Australia", "Nigeria", "Nicaragua", "China", "France", "Jordan")
tempo <- d %>% ungroup() %>% dplyr::filter(country %in% cty)
ggplot(tempo,
       aes(y = polity4, x = lrgdpch, color = country)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se=F) 
```

## Fixed effects

Simple idea: control for "belonging to a group" using group-level Fixed Effects

-   A way to control for *every* unobserved group characteristic that ***does not change***

-  In practice: give an intercept to each group

- Notice: only one slope!

## Fixed effects

Go from

```{=tex}
\begin{equation*}
Dem_{it} = \alpha + \beta_1 Dem_{it} + \epsilon_{it}
\end{equation*}
```
To

```{=tex}
\begin{align*}
Dem_{it} = &\alpha + \beta_1 Dem_{it} + \mu_1 USA + \\
\mu_2 France & + ... \mu_n Zimbabwe + \epsilon_{it}
\end{align*}
```



## Empirical example

```{r rep3, include=T, message=F, error=F, echo = T, tidy=TRUE}

mod <- lm_robust(polity4~lag_dem + lag_income, clusters = country, data = d)
modelsummary::modelsummary(mod, stars = T, coef_omit = "(Intercept)",  gof_omit = "AIC|BIC|Log.Lik|F|R2")
```


## Add Fixed Effects

```{r rep5, include=T, message=F, error=F, echo = T, tidy=TRUE}
require(estimatr)
mod2 <- lm_robust(polity4~lag_dem + lag_income, fixed_effects = country + year, clusters = country, data = d)

modelsummary::modelsummary(mod2, stars = T, coef_omit = "(Intercept)",  gof_omit = "AIC|BIC|Log.Lik|F|R2")

```

## Summing up

-   Good theoretical reasons to think

    -   Democracy is causally related to development

-   Most extant work focuses on the micro, sub national dynamics

-   But the broad theoretical argument is old!

-   Fixed effects can help control for **time invariant** unobserved confounders

-   If we think confounders might change in time (which they often do!) then FE cannot help
