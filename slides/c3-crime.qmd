## Agenda

-   Bateson, 2012

-   Weaver and Lerman, 2010

## Why does the state exist?

::: fragment
**The provision of security as the central reason for the state**

-   Hobbes: Prevent chaos $\rightarrow$ Protect our lives
-   Locke: Prevent abuse $\rightarrow$ Protect our property (including our lives)
:::

## What do states do?

::: fragment
**States provide public goods/services:**

-   Health, schools, infrastructure
-   The provision of security (internal and external)
:::

## Security and Development

-   Security often thought as a prerequisite of development
    -   Why?
-   Conversely, internal violence (civil war) characterized as “development in reverse” (Collier, 2004)
    -   Why?

## The inevitability of internal conflict

-   Yet, states often fail to provide internal security

-   Particularly developing states

-   Political violence, civil war, and most commonly… crime

## Crime in the Developing World

**Crime often identified as main concern of developing-world citizens**

## Crime in the Developing World

\
**Consequences for Development?**

::: fragement
-   In Latam, the most violent region in the world, the direct costs of crime in 2022 reached 3.44% of the region’s GDP [(Source: IDB)](https://www.iadb.org/en/news/high-crime-costs-burden-latin-america-and-caribbean#:~:text=November%2011%2C%202024.%20%2D%20Direct%20costs%20of,times%20the%20budget%20for%20research%20and%20development.)

    -   *"The cost of crime is equivalent to 78% of the public budget for education, double the public budget for social assistance, and 12 times the budget for research and development."*

-   At least 115k people were murdered in Latin America and the Caribbean during 2023
:::

## Police

-   The state’s main tool to respond to insecurity is the police
-   Yet police in developing context are often repressive, abusive, over-target poor and marginalized communities.

::: fragement
-   Could policing backfire?
:::

## Crime and its Punishment

-   What are the consequences of criminal violence?
-   What are the consequences of poor policing?

## Bateson, 2012

**Research Question:** Can crime motivate people to participate more in politics?

::: incremental
-   If the answer is “no” then crime could trigger a vicious circle of disengagement $\rightarrow$ poor governance $\rightarrow$ worse developmental outcomes

\

-   If the answer is “yes” then violence today might (ironically) mean better outcomes tomorrow: crime $\rightarrow$ participation $\rightarrow$ Better development outcomes
:::

## Theoretical Expectations

\
**Why might we expect crime to depress political participation?**

::: fragment
-   Fear
-   Cost of participating
:::

**Why might we expect crime to spur political participation?**

::: fragment
-   Psychological reasons
-   Instrumental reasons
:::

## A quick aside

\
**What were your priors?**

## Context / Data

\
**Author leverages four regional surveys**

1.  Americas Barometer
2.  Eurobarometer
3.  Asian Barometer
4.  Afrobarometer

You can download all of these surveys yourself!

## Measurement

**What is the dependent variable?**

::: fragment
-   Non-electoral participation
    -   community action
    -   protest
    -   political interest
    -   town meetings
:::

**What is the treatment or independent variable?**

::: fragment
-   Direct or indirect criminal victimization in the past year
:::

## Research Design

\
**Conditional Independence Assumption or Selection on Observables**

Treatment Group:

::: fragment
-   Direct or indirect victims
:::

Control Group:

::: fragment
-   Non-victims
:::

Controls:

::: fragment
-   Age, Education, Gender, Urban, Country FE
:::

## Threats to Inference

**The author makes causal claims, what crucial assumption is she making?**

::: fragment
-   No confounders!
    -   After including controls, who gets victimized is independent of participation decisions
-   Assumption would not hold if:
    -   People who participate more are more likely to be *crimed*
    -   People who participate more are more likely to report they were *crimed*
:::

## Is Causality Plausible?

## Results

![](img/batesonresults.png){fig-align="center"}

## Updating on the Results

**Crime victims everywhere participate more in politics, regadless of the type of crime**

-   Effect is roughly the same as 5-10 years of education (!!!)
-   Author also finds that victims are more skeptical of democracy, support authoritarianism, and vigilantism

Q1: Do we believe the results? Q2: What implications for democracy and development?

# Weaver and Lerman, 2010

## Context

\
For US citizens, contact with the criminal justice system is more common now than ever before

-   1/100 US citizens are incarcerate
-   1/3 black men will sever time in prison
-   Citizens routinely have unwanted/disciplinary interactions with police
-   Especially the disadvantaged populations\

::: fragment
Authors call the spacial concentrated, punitive, surveillance-oriented system found in some (minority) communities "carceral state”
:::

## Research Question

*How and in what ways encounters with the criminal justice system influence citizens’ political attitudes?*

-   More specifically:

    -   How does exposure to the criminal justice system socialize those exposed to it?
    -   What do people learn from constant, unwanted, aggressive, interactions with the state’s criminal system?

## Theory

Interactions with the criminal system shape participation through two channels:

-   Resources:
    -   Policy, including security policy, shapes availability of resources (i.e. spend \$ in court, have a criminal record, etc.)
    -   Fewer resources $\rightarrow$ less political participation
-   Learning:
    -   What the authors call “interpretative effects”
    -   Encounters with bureaucrats teach citizens’ about the goals and nature of the government
    -   Bad experiences with police, courts, etc. may translate into bad impressions about the government

## Hypotheses

**Interactions with the criminal justice system will:**

::: fragment
1.  Depress participation and civic engagement
2.  Reduce trust in the government
:::

## Data

Data comes from two panel surveys

1.  National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health [(Add Health)](https://addhealth.cpc.unc.edu/)

    -   "20,000 adolescents who were in grades 7-12 during the 1994-95 school year, and have been followed for five waves to date"

2.  [Fragile Families and Child Well-being Study](https://ffcws.princeton.edu/documentation)

Both surveys are publicly available and VERY RICH (and linked in the slides)

## Measurement

Treatment:

::: fragment
-   Criminal Justice Contact: no encounters, stopped by the police, charged, arrested, served time)
:::

Outcomes:

::: fragment
-   Electoral participation
-   Civic participation
-   Political participation
-   Trust in government
-   Civic obligations (jury, military)
:::

## Research Design

**Conditional Independence Assumption or Selection on Observables**

-   Multivariate OLS regression

-   Threats to inference: confounders!

-   What might predict participation and contact with criminal system?

::: fragment

-   Personality, criminality, income, education, etc.

-   Authors try to control for all these and run placebos to test whether they might be driving the results

:::

## Results

![](img/weaverlermanresults.png)

## Implications

-   Criminal justice contact deters political and civic life
-   Especially for marginalized populations who are over-policed
-   Who should security policy be responsive to?
-   Implications for democracy?
-   For inequality?

## Upside down world?

-   Both crime and its punishment have important implications for politics
-   Crime engenders participation and policing deters it (???)
-   A cause and a consequence of development
-   What is the appropriate response to crime? A **very** hard question to answer

## For researchers

-   Both of these papers were published in the highest ranked journal of political science
-   Both use survey data which you yourself could have downloaded
-   You could have run all the analyses!
-   Why are they published where they are?
-   Why are they so influential?
