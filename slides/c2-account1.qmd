## Assignments

-   Two assignments due TODAY/Wed at midnight:

1.  Creating a Final Project Git Repo

2.  Idea for Final Research Project

-   Please send a Slack DM to both me and Jeremy

## Agenda

-   Background (Accountability 101)
-   Ferraz and Finan, 2011

# Democracy, Accountability, and Representation

## Przeworski, Stokes, and Manin, 1999

::: incremental
**What do we mean by representation?**

-   Acting in the voter's best interests

-   What is the claim connecting democracy and representation?

-   Under democracy, governments are representative because they are elected.

-   But why?
:::

## Mandate view:

**Elections serve to select good policy**

::: incremental
-   Fundamentally *prospective*
-   During campaign parties inform citizens what policies they want to follow and why
-   Voters select the best one
-   Politicians do what they propose (the platform is the mandate)
:::

## Accountability view

**Elections serve to hold governments accountable for their past actions**

::: incremental
-   Fundamentally *retrospective*

-   Voters retain politicians only when they acted in their best interest

-   Politicians anticipate this and serve!
:::

## Taking stock

-   Do we feel these mechanisms are plausible?

-   What might be some issues with these characterizations of representation?

## Reconsidering: Some potential pitfalls

::: incremental
-   Citizens are not omniscient, *for better and for worse*

-   Imperfect evaluation of what politicians **should do**

-   Imperfect evaluation of whether they did what they **ought to have done**

-   Politicians have goals, interests, and values of their own, and monitoring is costly
:::

## Pitfalls in the Mandate View

-   Is it plausible to think governments will do what they propose?

-   Is it desirable?

-   Politicians are not legally compelled to abide by their platform in any democratic system! Why?

## Pitfals in the Accountability View

-   Idea is reward or punish depending on their performance

-   Is it plausible to think citizens have enough information to evaluate politicians?

-   What if politicians do not value getting reelected

## The Vote: Our One Blunt Tool

-   In the accountability view, voters are retrospective.

    -   They use the vote to punish

-   In the mandate view, voters are prospective

    -   They use the vote to select the best policy / best politicians

-   In reality, voters want to do both: select good policy and punish bad behavior

-   But we only have one vote. Can we achieve both goals?

# Evidence from Brazil: Ferraz and Finan (2011)

## Research question

::: incremental
-   Broadly: Do institutions affect accountability?

-   Specifically: Do elections work as a disciplining device?

-   Reelection Incentives $\rightarrow$ corruption
:::

## Theory

\

**Politicians who can get reelected have fewer incentives to steal funds**

- Why?

::: fragment
-   They want to get reelected! To get reelected, they need to serve the citizens.

-   Voting as a disciplining tool
:::

## Case, Data

-   Context: Municipalities in Brazil

    -   Brazilian mayors allowed to run for reelection starting in 2000

-   Data: Misappropriated Funds

    -   Random audits of municipalities since 2003

## Hypotheses

::: fragment
-   Hypothesis 1: Mayors that can still get reelected will steal less

-   Hypothesis 2: Especially when the "theft" is very visible
:::

## Research Design

-   What is the treatment group?
-   What is the control group?
-   What are plausible threats to inference?

## Research Design

## Research Design

\ 
**Constrain the Comparison**

::: fragment

  - Compare mayors who barely won and barely lost
  - Compare 1st term mayors that later won to 2nd term mayors
  - Compare mayors of equal experience
  - Compare similar places only
    
:::
    
## Findings

![](img/ferrazfinan2011_table.png){fig-align="center"}

## Findings

-   Mayors who can still run for reelection are less corrupt.

    -   Around 1.9-4 pp less corrupt than 2nd term mayors

-   Because around 7.4% of all resources were stolen under 2nd term mayors, a 1.9-4 pp decrease is HUGE and A LOT of money

## Robustness

\

**"If my story is true, what else should I observe in the data?"**

::: fragment

- 1s term mayors procure more \$ from the fed. gov (effort)
- Effects smaller where opposition is weak (who else are you going to vote for??)

:::

## Implications for Representation

-   That 1st term mayors are less corrupt suggests votes are a good disciplining device

    -   The accountability theory seems to have empirical support

-   But... is this evidence that voting does not help select good politicians?

-   Could both mechanisms be operational?

## Policy Implications

-   Corruption is more pervasive in weakly institutionalized settings

    -   How to make local governments in those settings more accountable?

-   Implications for term limits?

-   Implications for politicians' salaries?
