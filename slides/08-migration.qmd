# Migration Overview

## Overview of International Migration

![](img/un_migration.png){fig-align="center"}

## Economic Equilibrium

\

- Push factors
- Pull factors
- Costs

## Economic Equilibrium: Push

\

**Push factors: origin country factors that affect the well-being**

::: {.fragment}
::: {.incremental}
- Demographics: youth bulge
- Living standards: poor infrastructure, crime
- Economic opportunities: unemployment
- Politics: exclusion
:::
:::

## Economic Equilibrium: Pull

\

**Pull factors: destination country factors that affect expected well-being**

::: {.incremental}
- Demographics: aging population
- Living standards: good infrastructure, security
- Economic opportunities: labor demand, credit
- Politics: inclusion
:::

## Economic Equilibrium: Costs

\

**Costs: factors that shape the costs of migrating**

::: {.fragment}
::: {.incremental}
- Legal restrictions
- Transportation
- Asset mobility
:::
:::

## Economic Equilibrium Perspective

\

- Migration decisions are based on expected return
- Movements from poorer to richer regions will equalize wages


## Migration Systems


**Macro linkages between sending and receiving countries** 

- Migration is driven by prior links between sending and receiving countries 
  + Colonization, political or cultural influence, trade, language

**Micro linkages between households**

- Migration is driven by prior links between individuals and households 
  + Social ties to households in the destination country

# 3ie Evidence Review

## Irregular Migration Evidence Review

**Objective:**

- Review evidence efficacy of interventions designed to target the root causes of irregular migration

**Root causes: social and political conditions that induce departures**

1. Lack of economic opportunity
2. Lack of capacity to adopt to shocks
3. High levels of violence
4. Lack of regular migration channels


## Irregular Migration Evidence Review

\

**What is irregular migration?**

::: {.fragment}
- Migration outside legal channels
:::

**Why is it different from regular migration?**

::: {.fragment}
- Additional risks relative to legal migration (violence, exploitation, access to legal system)
:::

<!-- ## Whats the process -->

<!-- 1. Identify root causes of migration -->
<!-- 2. Look for papers assessing interventions on these root causes and with some reference to migration -->
<!-- 3. Find the subset of studies that specifically look at outcomes related to migration -->

## Findings

Studies reporting migration outcomes are concentrated on 3 intervention categories: 

1. Human capital strengthening 
2. Active labor market policies
3. Information campaigns 
<!-- legal rights, risks of irregular migration, legal alternatives, and/or working conditions -->

<!-- ## Evidence base -->

<!-- evidence base is concentrated in two domains: -->
<!-- 1. economic opportunities and decent work (n = 64)  -->
<!-- -- human capital strengthening (cash transfers) -->
<!-- -- active labor market policies (vocational training) -->
<!-- 2. orderly and safe migration managemen -->
<!-- -- information campaigns -->

<!-- we also see eivdnece on -->
<!-- 1. strengthening resilience against shocks -->
<!-- -- disaster risk financing (resistance seeds, crop management) -->

<!-- No evidence on: -->
<!-- - building safer communities through violence prevention -->
<!-- -- likely due to long time lags -->

<!-- ## Evidence base -->

<!-- RCTs: -->
<!-- - Cash transfers within the human-capital strengthening intervention category (e.g., -->
<!-- Angelucci 2004, 2013; Barham, Macours, and Maluccio 2018; Gazeaud et al. -->
<!-- 2022a); -->
<!-- - Vocational trainings and other active labor market policies (e.g., Ahn et al. 2020; -->
<!-- Hardy et al. 2019; Das 2017); and -->
<!-- - Information campaigns on the risks of migrating irregularly and other risks (e.g., -->
<!-- Beam, McKenzie, and Yang 2016; Tjaden and Dunsch 2021; Bah et al. 2023). -->

## Conclusions

\

- Some evidence on interventions that address the root causes of irregular migration
- Almost no evidence looking at irregular migration as a primary outcome
- A number of studies are ongoing


# Gazeaud et al. (2023)

## Constraints to migration

\

- Migration causes huge income gains
- Desire for migration is extremely high
- Actual migration flows are relatively small
- Why?

## Intervention

**Conditional cash transfer**

::: {.fragment}
- Cash payment for labor on public works
:::

::: {.fragment}
Mechanisms:
:::

::: {.fragment}
1. Liquidity
2. Opportunity cost
3. Collateral and access to credit
4. Risk-aversion
:::

## Findings

- Treatment households 38% more likely to migrate 
- Spillovers?
- Mechanisms?


## Findings

![](img/gazeud_mechanism.png){fig-align="center"}

## Policy Implications

::: {.fragment}
- The poorest individuals in sending countries are not the most likely to migrate ([Clements and Mendola, 2020](https://www.cgdev.org/publication/migration-developing-countries-selection-income-elasticity-and-simpsons-paradox))
- Improving welfare in sending countries will not necessarily reduce desire to migrate
- Networks may be less influential (over short time periods and with large pre-treatment migration)

# Difference-in Differences

## Identification strategy

**In the real world, there are always threats to inference that we can't measure/observe or understand well enough to adjust for**

- A *research design* that allows us to isolate a causal effect from observational data
- Approximates an experiment by ensuring that the treatment and control group are similar at baseline
- These strategies rely on assumptions that we can *attempt* to validate


## Holy Trinity of Causal Inference

\

1. **Difference-in-Differences**
2. Regression Discontinuity
3. Instrumental Variables


## Difference-in-Differences

\

$$
Y_{it} = \alpha + \beta_1 \text{Treatment}_i + \beta_2 \text{Post}_t + \gamma (\text{Treatment}_i \times \text{Post}_t) + \epsilon_{it}
$$

- $\gamma (\text{Treatment}_i \times \text{Post}_t)$
- Assumes measurement at two points in time

## Simulation Example

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show code"

# Load required libraries
library(dplyr)
library(modelsummary)

# Generate example data
set.seed(123)
data <- data.frame(
  treatment = rep(c(1, 0), each = 100),
  post = rep(c(1, 0), each = 50, times = 2),
  outcome = c(rnorm(50, mean = 10, sd = 2), # control: pre-treatment
              rnorm(50, mean = 10, sd = 2), # control: post-treatment
              rnorm(50, mean = 10, sd = 2), # treatment: pre-treatment
              rnorm(50, mean = 12, sd = 2)) # treatment: post-treatment
)

head(data)

```



## Simulation Example

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show code"

# Run difference-in-differences model
did_model <- lm(outcome ~ treatment * post, data = data)

# Summarize the output
modelsummary(
  list(lm(outcome ~ treatment + post, data = data), lm(outcome ~ treatment * post, data = data)),
  estimate  = "{estimate}{stars} ({std.error})",
             statistic = NULL,
  gof_omit = 'IC|RMSE|Log|F|R2$|Std.')

```


## DiD: Assumptions

- Treatment and control units would have changed in similar ways 
  + Parallel trends
- Requires *at least* 3 observation periods


## Why can't we just observe how units change over time?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show code"

library(ggplot2)

Year = c(0,1,2,3)
Outcome = c(NA, 1.3, 1.7, NA)
Treatment = c("Treatment", "Treatment","Treatment","Treatment")

dat = data.frame(Year, Outcome, Treatment)

ggplot(data = dat, aes(x = Year, y = Outcome, group = Treatment, color = Treatment)) +
  geom_line(aes(linetype=Treatment),size=2) +
  geom_point(size = 6) +
  xlim(0,3) + 
  ylim(0.8, 2.2) +
  scale_linetype_manual(values=c("solid", "solid")) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue") ) +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.8, 0.2), text = element_text(size=20),
        legend.title=element_blank())

```

## Sviatschi (2022)

\

- What is the effect of mass deportations on the root causes of migration?


## Three sources of variation

\

1. Geography (birth municipality)
2. Time (policy change)
3. Age (recruitment age)

## Identifying assumption

\

- Municipalities where gang-deportees were born would have changed in similar ways to other municipalities *in the absence of a policy change*


## Findings

![](img/sviatschi_did.png){fig-align="center"}

## Policy Implications

\

- Addressing pull factors can have unintended affects on push factors in complex ways


## Threats to Inference

\

- Confounders
- Colliders
- Mechanisms
- Reverse Causality

## Adjusting on Observables

\

- Matching
- Weighting
- Synthetic Control (very fancy weighting)

## Validity

::: {.incremental}
- Internal validity
- External validity
- What are the trade-offs between experiments and observational studies?
  + Experiments have more internal validity
  + But... they often have synthetic treatments, convenience samples
- Where are these studies used in the real-world?

<!-- ## Inference -->

<!-- Estimate = Estimand + Bias + Noise -->
<!-- Estimand: the true quantity of interest (e.g., the proportion of people who engage in bribery; the correlation between wealth and bribery) -->
<!-- Estimate: the number we get from our analysis. Our approximation to the true value.  -->
<!-- Estimator: the procedure we use to generate the estimate.  -->
<!-- Bias: errors that occur systematically -->
<!-- Noise: idiosyncratic (unsystematic) errors -->
