## Agenda

-   Development and Gender

-   Chattopadhyay and Duflo, 2004

-   Interaction Models

## Gender and Representation

-   Gender gap in political representation

    -   Women hold only 27.0% of legislative seats (Inter-Parliamentary Union, 2023)
    -   23% of cabinet positions (UNWOMEN)

-   Gender gap in political participation:

    -   Disputed gender gap in turnout, large variance

## Gender and Development

-   Gender and poverty (feminization of poverty to a degree)

-   Gender and economic participation

    -   Labor force participation gap: 27% globally (ILO, 2023)
    -   Gender wage gap [(Pew)](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2023/03/01/the-enduring-grip-of-the-gender-pay-gap/)

-   Gender and violence

    -   1/3 women have experienced GBV

-   Gender and education

    -   Literacy rates: 90% male vs. 83% female globally (World Bank Data, 2022)

    -   School attendance gap (UNESCO, 2023)

## Gender, Development, and Representation

-   The two are undoubtedly related

-   But could improving gender representation produce development?

```{r simple-dag, echo=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=3, fig.align='center'}

par(mar = c(1, 1, 1, 1), bg = NA) 
plot(0, 0, type = "n", xlim = c(0, 10), ylim = c(0, 2), 
     xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n", xlab = "", ylab = "", 
     main = "", bty = "n")

symbols(c(3, 7), c(1, 1), circles = c(1, 1), 
        inches = FALSE, add = TRUE, bg = "white")


text(3, 1, "Gender\nRepresentation", cex = 0.9)
text(7, 1, "Development\nOutcomes", cex = 0.9)

# Add arrow
arrows(4, 1, 6, 1, length = 0.1, lwd = 1.5)
```

## From Representation to development

**Why might having more women in office improve development?**

::: incremental
-   Women may want different things

-   Women may behave differently

-   Women may be better at their job

-   Women representatives may teach about equality
:::

## Our Expectations

-   **Different outcomes?**
    -   Do women prioritize different policy domains?
-   **Better outcomes?**
    -   Potential improvements in service delivery and reduced corruption
-   **Conditionally different outcomes?**
    -   Effectiveness depends on institutional context
    -   Critical mass may be necessary
    -   Interactions with other social identities

## Empirical Test?

-   Seems like a good theory with important implications that we want to validate empirically

-   Imagine we have data on share of female legislators and many development outcomes

-   We compare places with female politicians to places with male politicians and see development differences

-   What is the problem with this?

## A (more realistic) DAG

```{r complex-dag, echo=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, fig.align='center'}

par(mar = c(1, 1, 1, 1), bg = NA)  # Reduce margins and set transparent background
plot(0, 0, type = "n", xlim = c(0, 10), ylim = c(0, 6), 
     xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n", xlab = "", ylab = "", 
     main = "", bty = "n")  # bty="n" removes the box

# Define node positions
x_pos <- c(3, 7, 2, 5)
y_pos <- c(3, 3, 5, 5)
labels <- c("Gender\nRepresentation", "Development\nOutcomes", 
           "Previous\nDevelopment", "Gender\nNorms")

# Add nodes as circles
symbols(x_pos, y_pos, circles = rep(0.8, 4), 
        inches = FALSE, add = TRUE, bg = "white")

# Add text to nodes
text(x_pos, y_pos, labels, cex = 0.8)

# Add arrows
# Direct effect
arrows(3.8, 3, 6.2, 3, length = 0.1, lwd = 1.5)

# Confounding paths
arrows(2, 4.2, 2.7, 3.8, length = 0.1, lwd = 1, lty = 2)  # Previous dev -> Gender rep
arrows(2, 4.2, 6.3, 3.8, length = 0.1, lwd = 1, lty = 2)  # Previous dev -> Dev outcomes

arrows(5, 4.2, 3.7, 3.8, length = 0.1, lwd = 1, lty = 2)  # Gender norms -> Gender rep
arrows(5, 4.2, 6.3, 3.8, length = 0.1, lwd = 1, lty = 2)  # Gender norms -> Dev outcomes

# Add legend
legend(1, 1, 
       legend = c("Direct effect", "Confounding paths"), 
       lty = c(1, 2), 
       lwd = c(1.5, 1), 
       cex = 0.7,
       bty = "n")
```

## Gender Quotas: What are they?

-   Rules requiring minimum women's representation in politics

-   Goal: Improve gender parity in government

-   Vary by country, region, and level of government

-   Typically set minimum thresholds (20-50%)

## Gender Quotas: Types

-   **Voluntary quotas**:
    -   Set by political parties themselves
    -   No legal enforcement
-   **Mandatory quotas**:
    -   Required by law
        -   **Reserved seats**:
            -   Specific seats only women can hold
        -   **Candidate quotas**:
            -   Parties must nominate certain % of women

## Gender Quota Adoption

-   Started in 1990s, expanded rapidly

-   Now used in about 130 countries

-   Most common in newer democracies

-   Less common in older democracies (US, Japan)

-   Highest representation achieved in Rwanda (61%)

## Chattopadhyay and Duflo, 2004

::: incremental
-   India reserved 1/3 of village council (panchayat) head positions for women (1993)

-   Reserved positions assigned by random lottery

-   Randomization creates natural experiment

-   Solves confounding problem $\rightarrow$ can identify causal effects!
:::

## In a nutshell

-   RQ: [What are the policy consequences of "mandated representation of women"?]{.fragment}

-   Hypothesis: [In reserved villages, there is more investment in goods women prioritize]{.fragment}

-   Mechanism: [Heterogeneous priorities]{.fragment}

-   Treatment: [Village council being randomly assigned to have female head]{.fragment}

-   Outcome: [Investment Decisions]{.fragment}

-   Data: [Sample of Villages]{.fragment}

## A bit more detail

\ 
$Y_{ij} = \beta_1 + \beta_2 * R_j + \beta_3 D_i * R_j + \sum_{l=1}^{N} \beta_l d_{li} + \epsilon_{ij}$

Where:
\

-   $Y_{ij}$ is an outcome of interest

-   $R_j$ takes the value of 1 if GM is reserved

-   $D_i$ is differences in request about that good (women - men)

-   $d_{li}$ are good Fixed Effects!

# Interaction Terms

## What are Interaction Terms?

-   An interaction term is the product of two variables used as a covariate in a regression model

-   Captures how the effect of one variable depends on the value of another variable

-   Powerful for testing conditional hypotheses
Â 
\
**Key Modeling Assumption**

An increase in $X$ is associated with an increase in $Y$ only when a specific condition is met

## Recap: OLS Interpretation Basics
\

$Y_{i} = \alpha + \beta_1 * X_i + \beta_2 * Z_i + \epsilon_{i}$ 

-   $\hat{\beta_1}$ represents the change in $Y$ when $X$ increases by one unit

-   $\hat{\beta_2}$ represents the change in $Y$ when $Z$ increases by one unit

- Why?

## Coefficients as Marginal Changes

A partial derivative of the equation shows how $Y$ changes when $X$ changes by 1:


\

$Y_{i} = \alpha + \beta_1 * X_i + \beta_2 * Z_i + \epsilon_{i}$ 

-   $\frac{\partial Y}{\partial X} = \beta_1$

-   $\frac{\partial Y}{\partial Z} = \beta_2$

## Interaction Effects

-   Idea, the effect of X on Y depends on Z

$Y = \alpha + \beta_1X + \beta_2Z + \beta_3(X*Z) + \epsilon$


## Think of it as another covariate!

```{r binary-table, echo=FALSE}
# Create a table showing binary interaction
binary_example <- data.frame(
  X = c(0, 1, 0, 1),
  Z = c(0, 0, 1, 1),
 `X*Z` = c(0, 0, 0, 1)
)
knitr::kable(binary_example, caption = "")
```

- What needs to happen for the new covariate to be 1?

## New model
\

$Y_{i} = \alpha + \beta_1 * X_i + \beta_2 * Z_i + \beta_3 * Z_i * X_i + \epsilon_{i}$


-   How to interpret $\beta_3$: [Expected change in Y when the product of $X \times Z$ increases by 1 unit.]{.fragment}

-   How to interpret $\beta_1$: [Change in Y when X increases by 1 unit AND $Z =0$]{.fragment}

-   How to interpret $\beta_2$: [Change in Y when X increases by 1 unit AND $X =0$]{.fragment}

## Back to Math!

\ 
**Why does the interpretation of $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ change?**

$Y_{i} = \alpha + \beta_1 * X_i + \beta_2 * Z_i + \beta_3 * Z_i * X_i \epsilon_{i}$ 

-   $\frac{\partial Y}{\partial X} = \beta_1 + \beta_3*Z_i$

-   $\frac{\partial Y}{\partial Z} = \beta_2  + \beta_3*X_i$

## Three Simple Rules for Interaction

1.  Use for conditional hypotheses

2.  Always include all constituent terms 

3.  Interpret $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ correctly

## Practical Example

- Lets simulate some data to see how we can fit an interactive model in R
- We are going to look at a binary covariate-

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| code-fold: true
#| centering: true
#| code-summary: "Show code"

require(tidyverse)
set.seed(12)
beta_0 <- 1    # Intercept
beta_1 <- -.5    # Coefficient for women's representation
beta_2 <- 1.5  # Coefficient for quota system
beta_3 <- 3    # Coefficient for interaction term
sigma <- 0.5   # Standard deviation of noise

interaction_data <- tibble(
  women_representation = runif(100, 0, 1),
  quota_system = sample(0:1, 100, replace = T)) %>%
  mutate(
    policy_outcome = beta_0 + 
      beta_1 * women_representation + 
      beta_2 * quota_system + 
      beta_3 * (women_representation * quota_system) + 
      rnorm(n(), 0, sigma))

```


## Visualize Conditional Relationship


```{r, results=T, echo=F}

ggplot(interaction_data, 
       aes(x = women_representation, 
           y = policy_outcome, 
           color = factor(quota_system))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(x = "% of Female Representatives",
       y = "Policy Outcome",
       color = "Quota?") + 
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = 3, type = "qual")

```

## Practical Example 

- You can fit the model with lm like usual 

```{r}

#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| code-fold: true
#| centering: true
#| code-summary: "Show code"
 
# Fit interaction model
interaction_model <- lm(policy_outcome ~  women_representation * quota_system, 
                        data = interaction_data)

summary(interaction_model)
```
