# Logistics


## Agenda

\

1. Finishing Foreign Aid (Soft Power)
2. Climate change overview

# Soft Power

## Soft Power

**Does aid win hearts and minds (soft power)?**

- Aid improves health and education outcomes
- Recipients seem to know who gives aid
- Aid often comes with conditionality and corruption
- [Andrabi and Das (2017)](https://direct.mit.edu/rest/article/99/3/371/58451/In-Aid-We-Trust-Hearts-and-Minds-and-the-Pakistan) use spatial data to show that disaster relief in Pakistan improved trust in US and Europe

## Geopolitics and Foreign Aid

- US Foreign Aid in 2023: \$60b
  + USAID \$44b; DoS \$14b; DoT and DoA \$2.5b
- Annual aid 2013-2018
  + China: \$7b
  + USA: \$44.7b
- Most Chinese aid is [loans (BRI)](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/can-china-fill-the-void-in-foreign-aid/)

## Geopolitics and Foreign Aid

**March earthquake in Myanmar**

- US pledged \$9m
  + Not clear that there's [anyone left to do this work](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/30/world/asia/myanmar-earthquake-usaid-cuts.html)
  + US 3-person team was fired while in-country
  + DART teams are layed-off; transportation contracts were killed
- [China pledged \$137m](https://councilonstrategicrisks.org/2025/04/11/china-seizes-an-opportunity-from-the-united-states-in-humanitarian-aid-and-disaster-response/)
  + They had teams working within 48 hours
- [17 other countries](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/10/asia/myanmar-quake-usaid-trump-intl-hnk/index.html) involved in response


## Filling the Gap

- De-funded human rights NGOs have been [approached by Chines donors](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/18/nx-s1-5300108/aid-cuts-and-china-muscles-in)
- China has replaced USAID programs [in Cambodia](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-26/as-trump-cuts-aid-china-flows-funds-to-strategic-corner-of-asia?mkt_tok=Njg1LUtCTC03NjUAAAGZcRkNfr46R5GC9SKCMEGpipU4wlw8QbRtkWvSqnNhucfidjk8r9pvNlK_rVGLd9JfgxlUePm2wf9ULBErKX833wpITSOYYWMCUcx7IaCKn8B6Exs&leadSource=uverify%20wall), [Nepal](https://theannapurnaexpress.com/story/52229/), and [Mongolia](https://councilonstrategicrisks.org/2025/04/11/china-seizes-an-opportunity-from-the-united-states-in-humanitarian-aid-and-disaster-response/)
- China and Russia have been buying-up and establishing [foreign media outlets](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/china-radio/)
- US is shutting down Voice of America (est. 1942)


## Kenya: Soft Power

> This investment is seen by policy analysts as a direct response by the [Chinese/United States] government to the [United States/Chinese] government’s announcement of similar projects in Kenya. Observers say this is part of a broader rivalry between the two great powers to gain international influence, with [China/the United States] aiming to outpace the [United States/Chinese] and develop strategic footholds across Africa. Kenya’s position as a regional hub makes it a key battleground in this global competition, as the United States and China race to secure political and economic influence in the region.

# Namrata (2023)

## Climate Adaptation

\

**Disproportionate vulnerability for developing countries**

:::{.fragment}
- Higher mean temperatures
- Greater impact of temperature on output
- Long coastlines 
- Lower incomes, smaller safety nets
:::

## Three literatures

\

- Quantifying vulnerabilities
- Measuring adaptation
- Spatial linkages


## Climate Adaptation

![](img/climate_map.png){fig-align="center"}

## Research Methods 

:::{.fragment}
- Panel data to find relationship between observed changes and output
- Project to future changes, assuming everything stays constant
- Problems:
  + Long-run adaptations
  + Short-run adaptations
  + Mechanisms?

:::

## Research Methods 

\

**Recent developments**

:::{.fragment}
- Long-run changes (climate vs weather)
- Focus on expectations
- Experiments with adaptation
:::

## Climate Adaptation

**Climate change mitigation strategies**

:::{.fragment}
- Weather insurance
- Migration
- Cash transfers
- Credit
- New technology
- Infrastructure
- Safety nets

# Albert at al. (2022)

## Measurement

:::{.fragment}
- Reported natural disasters
- Moisture deficit relative to long-run average
- Agriculture yields
- Bank loans
- Migration and labor

## Findings

## Findings

- Dryness causes reallocation of capital and labor
- Dryness lowers productivity and reallocates remaining labor away from agriculture and to manufacturing
- Capital connected areas see reduced 
- Labor connected areas see inflows
