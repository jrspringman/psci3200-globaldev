## Models of political accountability

**What is political accountability?**

- Accountability is meant to produce *responsiveness*
- Responsiveness means that a government "adopts policies that are signaled as preferred by citizens" (Manin, 1999)
- If governments fail to adopt citizens' preferred policies, they will be sanctioned

**Assumptions**
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Politicians have information about what citizens want
- Citizens have information about which policies a politician is responsible for
:::

## Models of political accountability

**Accountability requires that Voters:**

- Observe credible signal of performance
  + Attribution
  + Benchmarking
- Update their beliefs
- Have credible alternatives

## Models of political accountability

\

**Accountability requires that politicians:**

- Seek to maintain office
- Observe citizen preferences
- Update their beliefs

## Models of political accountability

**Distributional politics**

- Target public spending to maximize electoral advantage

**Responsiveness**

- Maximizing welfare across constituents

**Decentalization**

- Both sides have better information at a more local level

- Information gaps may explain disparities in public spending
- Information can reduce disparities

# Data Assignment Questions


# Final Project Essentials

## Fixed Effects

**What is an interaction term?**

- Simple linear models assume that the effect of predictors is independent of other factors 
- Interaction terms allow us to estimate the difference in the slope of a predictor across unit characteristics

**What are they used for?**

- Controlling for time-invariant group characteristics
- Difference-in-differences

## Fixed Effects

**How do they do work?**

$$
Y_i = \alpha + \beta_1 X_{i1} + \gamma_i + \epsilon_{it}
$$


**Example:** Continuous outcome with two binary predictors

- $\alpha$: Intercept when $X_{i1}$ and $X_{i2}$ are 0
- $\gamma_i$ Unique intercept for each group
- $\beta_1$ Slope when
