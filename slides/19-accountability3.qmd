# Dunning et al. (2019)

## Barriers hindering accumulation

\

**What is accumulation?**

:::{.fragment}
- Building knowledge across studies
:::

:::{.fragment}
**What makes it difficult?**
:::

:::{.fragment}
- Limited replication
- Heterogeneity of design and measurement
- Publication bias
:::

## Barriers hindering accumulation

## Facilitating accumulation 

\

**What solutions are discussed by the authors?**

:::{.fragment}
- Pre-registration
- Harmonizing theory, measurement, and estimation
- Publication of null results
:::



## Facilitating accumulation 

![](img/dunning_metaketa.png){fig-align="center"}


## Models of political accountability

**Accountability requires that voters:**

- Observe credible signal of performance
  + Attribution
  + Benchmarking
- Update their beliefs
- Have credible alternatives

## Models of political accountability

**What does the literature say?**

- Theory is mixed
  + Partisan and sectarian attachments are strong
  + Voters may be reluctant to update their beliefs
- Experimental results are mixed
  + Demobilization
  + Limited recall
  + Ephemeral effects

  
## Research Design

**Intervention**

:::{.fragment}
- Information on political *performance*
  + Legislative behavior
  + Spending irregularities
  + Budget allocation
  + Candidate experience
  
:::

## Research Design

**Accountability requires that voters:**

- Observe credible signal of performance
  + Attribution
  + Benchmarking
- Update their beliefs
  + Good news: $Q > P \mid 1(P = Q, Q > med(Q) )$
- Have credible alternatives


## Ecological Validity

\

- How is information disseminated?
- What is the real world activity being tested?


## Describing Information

![](img/dunning_pq.png){fig-align="center"}

:::{.notes}
- good news group is above the line 
- correlation is positive but weak
:::

## Problems hindering accumulation

![](plane.png){fig-align="center"}


## Research Design

\

**Core hypotheses:**

:::{.fragment}
1. Good news increases voter support for incumbents
2. Bad news decreases voter support for incumbents
3. Effect of information will increase with gap between Q and P
4. Strongest for nonpartisan and non-coethnic voters
:::

## Findings

![](img/dunning2.png){fig-align="center"}


## Why the null results?

:::{.fragment}
- Source credibility?
  + No...
- Lack of retention
- Lack of updating on politician performance 
- Lack of updating about politician quality
- Lack of coordination (private treatment)

:::


## Statistical Power

\

**Null results were not "foregone conclusion"?**

:::{.fragment}
- 80% power
- Change the vote of 5/100 voters
- Change turnout of 4/100 voters
:::



## Findings

## Findings

## Policy Implications

\

:::{.fragment}
- Much of the work funded by donors is probably not having an impact on accountability
- Targeting of information provision needs to be rethought
  + Public dissemination and coordination

# Data Assignment Questions


# Final Project Essentials

## Unit Fixed Effects

**What is a unit fixed effect?**

- Simple linear models make comparisons both across and within units (when there are multiple measures)
- Fixed effects 'absorb' variation across units; now coefficients estimate only the variation within units 
- This 'controls' for time-invariant heterogeneity

**What are they used for?**

- Reducing concerns about confounding
- Difference-in-differences

## Unit Fixed Effects

**Normal model**

$$
Y_it = \alpha + \beta_1 X_{it} + \epsilon_{it}
$$
**Unit fixed Effects model**

$$
Y_it = \gamma_i + \beta_1 X_{it} + \epsilon_{it}
$$


**Example:** Unit FEs with one binary predictor

- $\alpha$: $E[Y_i]$ when $X_{i1} = 0$
- $\gamma_i$: $E[Y_i]$ for every unit when $X_{i1} = 0$

## Unit Fixed Effects

**Unit fixed Effects model**

$$
Y_it = \gamma_i + \beta_1 X_{it} + \epsilon_{it}
$$


**How does the interpretation of $\beta_1$ change?

- $\gamma_i$: $E[Y_i]$ when $X_{it} = 0$
- $\beta_1$ Change in $E[Y_i]$ when $X_{it} = 1$
- Each $\gamma_i$ will absorb everything that doesnâ€™t vary over time in that unit
