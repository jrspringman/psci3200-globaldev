## Agenda

1.  Conceptualizing Democracy
2.  Measuring Democracy
3.  Majoritarian Threat to Democracy (Grossman et. al.)
4.  On Wed: Democracy and development (And Fixed Effects)

## What is Democracy?

::: incremental
-   Not an easy question to answer!

-   One might even say polemic...

    -   Etymology? **Demokratia** = demos + kratia

    -   Is it about elections? About outcomes? About norms?

-   Academics often talk about **minimalist** (procedural)

-   and **maximalist** (substantive) conceptions of democracy.
:::

## What is Democracy? The Minimalists

Democracy as a PROCEDURE for choosing and replacing who rules us

::: incremental
-   Schumpeter: a system in which rulers are selected by competitive elections

-   Popper: a system in which citizens can replace governments without bloodshed

-   Przeworksi: a system in which citizens collectively decide by whom and, to some extent, how they will be governed
:::

## What is Democracy? The Maximalists

"Thick'' definition of democracy

::: incremental
-   Democracy as system that **embodies** or a method for **realizing** extrinsic values

-   Democracies classified based on **formal institutions** and rules, **how those institutions are used** in practice, and what **outcomes** they produce

    -   Do the rules, the way they are used, and their consequences promote equality, accountability, participation, justice, dignity, security ...
:::

## Minimalists vs. Maximalists

Common critique of procedural conceptions of democracy:

::: incremental
-   is that it is too thin and mostly electoral.

-   But is it really that minimal?

    -   What do we require to hold "free and fair" elections?
        -   At least civil and political rights, neutral electoral machinery, stability, competing parties, etc...
        -   Respect for the rules of the game ...
:::

## Minimalists vs. Maximalists

Common critique of maximalist perspective:

::: incremental
-   Democracy becomes subjective

    -   Whatever values we view as democratic need not be the other persons' views
    -   Hard to measure, hard to compare across time and space

-   If democracy is only justifiable for its outcomes, we may risk autocracy during bad times
:::

## Are you a maximalist or a minimalist?

What is a necessary condition for a system to be democratic?

::: incremental
-   Does it need to hold elections?

-   Does everyone need to be able to vote?

-   Does everyone need to be able to run for office?

-   Have an independent legislative body?

-   Independent media?

-   Economic equality?
:::

## What is an autocracy

-   A fundamentally residual category!

## Measuring democracy

1.  Minimalist (Yes/No)
    -   [Democracy-Dictatorship score](https://sites.google.com/site/joseantoniocheibub/datasets/dd) (ends in 2008 sadly)
        -   Democracy if: Executive is elected, legislature is elected, more than one party, has been an alternation of power under current rules
2.  Maximalist
    -   [Polity IV/V (from -10 to 10)](https://www.systemicpeace.org/polityproject.html)

        -   Spectrum of: competitiveness, openness, participation, checks and balances

    -   [Freedom house](https://freedomhouse.org/countries/freedom-world/scores) (0-100)

        -   Experts rate: access to political rights and civil liberties

## The Value of Democracy

1.  *Per se*

    -   The fairest system as normatively desirable.
    -   Political freedom is human freedom.

2.  Instrumental (i.e gets you something else)

    -   The best way to prevent abuse is by making our rulers dependent on us.

    -   We can select the most competent rulers.

    -   Pacification of the political life.

    -   Economic Development

## If Democracy is Valuable...

Then we want to keep it safe!

::: incremental
-   Democracies are stronger when citizens hold politicians accountable

-   But... what if people knowingly support antidemocratic governments or antidemocratic behavior from politicians?
:::

## The Majoritarian Threat to Liberal Democracy

*Grossman, Kronick, Levendusky, and Meredith, 2022*

-   Puzzle: voters often ignore or even support politicians' power grabs. Why?

    -   Extant research shows some people prefer nondemocratic governments (autocrats)

    -   While others prioritize their partisan objectives over democratic principals (militants)

::: incremental
-   But the authors suggest there is a third type ...
:::

## The Majoritarian Threat to Liberal Democracy

-   Majoritarians:

::: incremental
-   People who believe popular elected leaders are justified in taking legal but "antidemocratic" steps

-   What do we mean by that?

-   How to identify these people in the population?
:::

## Research Design

-   Two survey experiments. We will focus on the first one

-   Vignette --\> outgoing governor announces that he will appoint a replacement for a state SCJ instead of waiting for incoming governor from opposite party

    -   Not **illegal** but not **"democratic"**

::: incremental
-   Respondents are assigned to a treatment or control condition.

-   What is the treatment?
:::

## Research Design

Randomly assigned whether the outgoing governor is a co-partisan of respondents

::: incremental
-   Outcomes?

    1.  Do you approve of what the outgoing governor did?
    2.  Do you think it's consistent with democracy?

-   Assumptions?

    1.  Treatment and control groups are the same across all relevant dimensions, in expectation

## Results

## Discussion

-   Are majoritarians antidemocratic? Are partisans?

    -   What would the minimalists say?
    -   What would the maximalists say?

-   What implications does the existence of majoritarians have for democratic quality?
