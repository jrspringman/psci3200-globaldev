# Introductions

## Me

Background:

-   PhD from UPenn PSCI, Postdoc at Duke
-   *Very* applied work

Interests:

-   Democracy and civil society, foreign aid and NGOs 
-   Randomized experiments, machine learning
-   Field Projects: Uganda, Ethiopia, Cambodia, Serbia
<!-- -   Improving research for decision makers -->

## You

\

Please tell us:

-   Name, Year, Major
-   One thing you're interested in
-   One thing you'd like to get from the course


# Course Description and Objectives

## Course Description

::: {.r-stack}

- Blending subject-matter, research methods, and computational tools
- Focusing on the type of work that goes on with and within development agencies 
- Almost no math; very little theory

![](basics_tweet.png){.fragment .fade-up }

:::

::: {.notes}
- Best suited for folks that have small background in all 3 areas
- 
:::

## Course Description

- Follow-up to PSCI 1102
  + 1102 covered big academic debates that we won’t (ex. institutions vs geography)
  + This research is the domain of academics conducting *basic research*
- Focus on *applied research* with development agencies/industry 
  + We *can’t* change geography or airlift new institutions
  + We *can* use insights from academic work to improve governance and wellbeing (malaria pills, institutional reforms) 

::: {.notes}

- super applied work is based partly on big picture/theory/basic research, so we’ll see some of that too
- I’ll often focus on my own research because it’s highly applied and you can get a sense of what research looks like mid-stream
:::

## Course Description

\

- Substantive focus areas
  + Democracy and Autocratization
  + Migration
  + Crime and Conflict
  + Foreign Aid
  + Climate change and adaptation

## Course Description

- Methods: 
  + Deepen understanding of 'workhorse' statistical methods and research designs
  + How these methods can be used to make inferences about population characteristics and causal relationships
- Tools
  + Introduce the computational tools that are needed to implement these methods 
  + Software necessary to prepare professional documents and reproducible data analysis workflows

## Course Objectives

At the end of the course you should be able to:

- Evaluate the quality of evidence in the development field
- Think clearly about how data can be used to learn about development and governance challenges
- Use tools for data analysis such as R, RStudio, Quarto, and GitHub
- Produce professional-quality documents that summarize original research

# Requirements and Policies

## Prerequisites

\

- Substance
  + Big academic debates in development research (PSCI 1102)
- Methods and Tools (PSCI 1800)
  + Basic familiarity with R and RStudio
  + Basic knowledge of statistics/econometrics/data science

::: {.notes}

if you didn’t take 1102, talk with me; I can give you a copy of the syllabus

## Textbook

\

- [Data Analysis for Social Science: A Friendly and Practical Introduction (DSS)](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691199436/data-analysis-for-social-science)
  + We will use DSS as a jumping-off point for this course
  + Some of this material will be review


## Grading

Performance in this class will be evaluated by according to performance on the following course requirements:

| Requirement      | Percent of Final Grade |
|:-----------------|:-------------|
| Quizzes (4)          | 10%          |
| Workshops (4)        | 10%          |
| Data Assignments (3) | 36%          |
| Final Project (1)    | 44%          |

## Quizzes

\

- On 4 randomly selected meetings, there will be a brief quiz 
- If you paid any attention or did readings, you should get full credit
- One pre-approved absence allowed

## Workshops

- 4 interactive, hands-on workshops working with diverse types of data, covering different statistical methods, or using new computational tools. 
  + Tools: Quarto, github
  + Data: Survey data, text data, financial data
  + Methods: Randomized and quasi-experiments, network analysis
- You will be required to submit a product demonstrating completion of the workshop

## Data Assignments

- 3 data assignments designed to give you an opportunity to apply tools and methods discussed in readings, lectures, and workshops to data from the real world
- You will be required to submit your own code and write-up

| Data Assignment | Due Date|
|:----------------|:--------|
| Assignment 1 | Feb 29th  |
| Assignment 2 | Mar 21st  |
| Assignment 3 | Apr 25th  |


## Final Project

- Data analysis project with data of your choosing
  + Formulate a research question
  + Find data that can help you answer that question
  + Apply the tools and methods from this course
  + Write-up analysis
- Produce a webpage to present your results for public consumption 

::: {.notes}
Your final submission will be a publicly available webpage that contains: (1) a brief introduction to your research question and data; (2) a discussion of your research design, its assumptions, and threats to inference; (3) a visualization that describes your data; (4) a presentation of the results from a regression model (as a table or graph) and discussion of its implications for your research question; and (5) a discussion of the implications of your findings for development policy or practice, including the limitations of your analysis and suggestions for future research.

## Final Project

\

| Milestone                    | Due Date                 |
|:-----------------------------|:-------------------------|
| Create a GitHub repository   | Feb 8th |
| Identify data source         | Mar 5th |
| Submit proposal              | Apr 2nd |
| Submit final project         | May 2nd |

By April, I'll give you a break-down of how the grading will be done

# Policies

## Late Submissions and Regrading

- Late submission of assignments
  + penalty of 2 points for every day late
  + except in **documented** cases of serious illness or family emergency
- Regrade request
  + detailed write-up of your dispute
  + Regrade of the entire assignment (might increase or decrease) 

## Use of AI Tools

- You are welcome to use generative AI tools
- It is important to gain experience integrating them into professional tasks
- AI tools frequently make errors and 'hallucinate' (journal articles, R functions, etc.)
- It is your responsibility to verify the information provided 
- You *must* disclose your use of AI tools for assignments in the form of footnotes or citations


## Electronic Devices

\

- Laptops will be required in class
- All other electronic devices should be silenced and hidden
- Please don't make me devise consequences for violating this policy

## Controversial Topics and Statements

- Diverse perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds are essential for effective development research and practice
- Contact me directly if you feel we're not achieving an inclusive environment
- Students are required to treat one another with respect
- Engage with any evidence that challenges your prior beliefs


## Academic Honesty

- Students are expected to follow the University of Pennsylvania's [Code of Academic Integrity](https://catalog.upenn.edu/pennbook/code-of-academic-integrity/)
- Suspected violations will be referred to university administration for disciplinary action.
