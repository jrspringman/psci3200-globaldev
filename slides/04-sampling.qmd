# Logistics

## Poll

- Mac vs Windows?
- Quarto running?

## Assignments

- Today
  + Read Ch 3
  + Install Quarto and create an empty html
- Thursday 
  + Read Ch 4
  + Create a git repo for this class (psci3200_name)

## Agenda

1. Finishing up Causality 1
2. Inferring Population Characteristics via Survey Research
3. Messing around in Quarto

# Finishing up Causality 1

## Identifying Assumptions

::: {.incremental}
- You must control for...
  + everything (observed and unobserved) that affects both the treatment variable and the outcome variable
- You *must not* control for...
  + anything that is affected by both the treatment variable and the outcome variable

## Colliders

```{r edu-ex-full, echo=FALSE, fig.width=9, fig.height=4.5, out.width="100%"}

::: {.notes}
In this case, the illusion was the appearance of correlation (or statistical dependence) between the independent causes, giving rise to the theory that some locations receive more bullets than others (perhaps by being more exposed) when in fact the enemy sprayed them uniformly.
The army observed more holes in the fuselage than the engine and recommended more armor on the former. This dependence however was created by selection bias.

## Plumbing vs Science

::: {.incremental}
- Scientists can tell us the drivers of human welfare and prosperity
  + Can we manipulate these macro-forces? Probably not.
- So what can we do as social scientists?
  + Help at the margins in specific places with specific policies and programs

::: {.fragment}
- Any normatively uncomfortable findings?

# Inferring Population Characteristics via Survey Research


## Survey Research
-   In social sciences, we often want to learn *something* about a population of interest
-   However, collecting data on the entire population might be too expensive or unfeasible. 
-   Objective of a **survey**: to collect data from a *subset* of observations from the population of interest to understand something about the entire population.


## Sample
-   The subset of individuals chosen for the survey.
-   It is important that the sample chosen is *representative* of the population of interest. 

    -   A sample that accurately reflects the characteristics of the population from which it is drawn.
    -   If the sample is *not* representative, our inferences are invalid (we introduce *bias*) in our estimates. 
    

## Sampling Strategies

-   Probability Sampling Strategies:

    -   Simple Random Sampling 
    -   Stratified sampling
    -   Cluster sampling
    
-   Non-Probability Sampling Strategies:

    -   Convenience sample


## Sampling Strategies

Simple Random Sampling

-   The best way of drawing a representative sample from a population. 
-   Each and every individual within the population has the sample probability of being chosen.
-   With random sampling, as the sample size increases the characteristics of the sample more closely resemble the characteristics of the population.


## Potential Challenges when Sampling
-   To implement random sampling we need a complete list of *all* individuals in the population (this list is known as *sample frame*).

    -   Obtaining a complete sample frame is not always possible. 
    -   The missing observations tend to differ systematically from those included in the list.
    -   E.g., A list of all studets at USU to conduct a survey about students' opinions.
    
    
## Potential Challenges when Sampling
-   **Unit nonresponse**: even when our sample frame is complete, some individuals may choose not to answer.

    -   IF the individuals who refuse to participate differ systematically from those that do participate, the resulting sample will not be representative. 
    -   E.g., the students who refuse to answer might be the busiest.


## Potential Challenges when Sampling
-   **Item nonresponse**: some individuals may choose not to answer some questions.

    -   IF the missing answers differ systematically from the recorded answers, the data collected for that particular question will not accurately reflect the characteristics of the population.
    -   E.g., some students may prefer not to answer questions about delicate topics. 


## Potential Challenges when Sampling
-   **Misreporting**: some individuals may choose not to answer truthfully.

    -   This is particularly common with sensitive questions or when specific answers are seen as more socially desirable than others.
    -   Depending on the question, this problem may induce additional noise or, in the worse case, bias, into our measures.
    -   E.g., some students may answer that they really like Aggie Icecream even when they do not. 


## Stratified sampling

-   Divide the entire population into *homogeneous* sub-groups (*strata*). 
-   Then, take the random samples from each stratum and pool them together.
-   Strata can be based on income, educational level, race, or gender. 


## Cluster sampling

-   Divide de population into *clusters*. 
-   Then, then take a random sample of clusters (and then one more within each cluster) and pool the observations together
-   Observations within the clusters may be *similar*, but not homogeneous along any characteristic.

## Non-Probability Sampling Strategies

-   Convenience sample:

    -   Instead of randomly choosing participants, choose the ones that are easily available.
    

## Working with Survey Data

Measuring support for Brexit.

-   British Election Study (BES) Survey
-   Conducted about 6 weeks before the Brexit referendum (June 23, 2016)



## Final Project

- Data analysis project with data of your choosing
  + Formulate a research question
  + Find data that can help you answer that question
  + Apply the tools and methods from this course
  + Write-up analysis
- Produce a webpage to present your results for public consumption 

::: {.notes}
Your final submission will be a publicly available webpage that contains: (1) a brief introduction to your research question and data; (2) a discussion of your research design, its assumptions, and threats to inference; (3) a visualization that describes your data; (4) a presentation of the results from a regression model (as a table or graph) and discussion of its implications for your research question; and (5) a discussion of the implications of your findings for development policy or practice, including the limitations of your analysis and suggestions for future research.
