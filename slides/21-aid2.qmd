## Foreign Aid and Accountability

**Standard Channels**

:::{.fragment}
- Distribution of aid: Divert resources from needy to strategically valuable communities (clientelism)
- Reallocation of budgets: Divert resources from development (fungibility)
:::

**Donor strategies**

:::{.fragment}
- Project aid
- Channel through NGOs or direct transfers
- Generally cut government actors out of the process
:::

## Three Questions

**Three questions**

1. Do citizens perceive foreign aid projects?
2. How do politicians claim credit?
3. Under what conditions are they successful?

**Sources of updating**

- Credit for welfare improvement
- More likely to secure future projects

## Research Design

\

- Research question: Whether local politicians claimed undue credit for the projects to boost their re-election prospects
- Least likely design
  + Low chance for distribution or reallocation

## Undeserved Credit Claiming

- Concept Definition: Politicians claiming credit for foreign aid projects they had no role in securing
- Mechanism: Exploiting the lack of transparency and information among voters
- Implications: Misleads voters, potentially undermining accountability and governance quality

## Findings

- Increased Visits: Politicians visited project sites more frequently to appear involved
- Election Impact: 12% increase in re-election chances
- Political Credit: Mayors are credited for funding or initiating projects even when respondents knew of other funding ssources

## Policy Implications    

\

- Designing Aid Projects: Importance of transparency and community involvement to minimize undeserved credit claiming
- Voter Education: Enhancing voters' understanding of aid processes to better hold politicians accountable
- Involvement: Giving opportunities to contribute makes credit deserved

   
# Brief History of Non-State Service Provision


## Introduction

**Topics**

1. Service delivery and the state
2. A brief history of non-state service delivery
3. Contemporary non-state service delivery

**Learning Objectives**

- What types of non-state actors are involved in service delivery in Africa?
- What are the main causes of the emergence and growth of these organizations, and what are their likely consequences for citizen welfare and state capacity?
- What are the limiting factors that are likely to prevent these actors from supplanting state service provision?

## Service Delivery & The State

**What do states do?** (Hoffman, 2015)

- Monopolize violence
- Levy taxes
- Obtain the assent of the population

**Why is public service delivery (PSD) important?**

- Promotes economic growth
- Improves welfare of citizens

## The Social Contract

**Mutual reliance between states and citizens**

- States need tax revenue
- Citizens need public services
  - Provision of clean water accounts for 60% of the increase in life expectancy in the United States between 1850 and 1950 [@troesken2001].

**Virtuous cycle between taxation, PSD, and state capacity**

- Taxation $\Rightarrow$ citizen demand for PSD
- Government PSD $\Rightarrow$ citizen compliance with taxation
- Citizen compliance with taxation $\Rightarrow$ increased state capacity
- Citizen reliance on PSD $\Rightarrow$ political accountability [@hoffman2005]


## The Fiscal Exchange [@bodea2014]

**How does this work in social contexts without direct taxation?**

**Exchange-driven social contract emergence**

- Compliance obtains when people expect that services will be delivered
- Compliance is *conditional*

**Norm-driven social contract emergence**

- Tax morale and civic duty
- Compliance is *internalized*


## A Brief History of Service Delivery in Africa

**Service delivery in the pre-colonial period**

- Pre-colonial African states did not engage in extensive service delivery [@herbst2000]
  - States weren't geographically bounded
- Christian missions were (kinda) the first service providers
  - Emphasis on literacy and formalizing indigenous languages
  - Competing with traditional healers [@chirwa2016]

**Colonial approaches to service delivery**

- Traditional medicine was outlawed [@chirwa2016]
- The church is "cemented" as the primary service provider [@jennings2014]
  - **Tanzania at the end of the colonial period**
  - Church operated 81% of primary health facilities
  - Church-operated schools outnumbered government schools 4-to-1

## A Brief History of Service Delivery in Africa

**Post-colonial period**

- Post-colonial African states nationalized service delivery infrastructure and increased spending dramatically
- Spending was unsustainable [@bates2014; @brass2014]
  - **Kenya's Civil Services** [@young1994]
  - 1945: 14,000
  - 1955: 45,000
  - 1978: 170,000
- Commodity boom $\Rightarrow$ commodity bust
- Structural adjustment
  - **Kenya's Health Spending** [@brass2014]
  - 1980: $9.8 million
  - 1993: $6.2 million
  - 1996: $3.6 million

## The Re-Entry of Non-State Providers

*In 2007, 9% and 16% of US economic engagement with developing countries has been Official Development Assistance and private philanthropy respectively* [@kapur2010].

## The Re-Entry of Non-State Providers

![](img/ingo.png){fig-align="center"}

## The Re-Entry of Non-State Providers

**Faith Based Organizations (FBOs)** [@green2002]

- Church "umbrella" organizations (ex. Uganda Protestant Medical Bureau)
  - Less reliant on aid [@reinikka2010]
  - More reliant on user-fees [@munthali2015]
  - Focus on facility-based care in rural areas
  - Cost-sharing with government
  - Uganda: 45% of the hospital beds; â…“ of the country's health workers [@tumwesigye2013]
- International religious FBOs (ex. World Vision)
  - Operate more like secular NGOs
- What do FBOs have in common? [@jennings2014]

## The Re-Entry of Non-State Providers

**Malawi: Number of health facilities**

| Year | Gov  | FBO  | NGO |
|------|------|------|-----|
| 2005 | 426  | 160  | 32  |
| 2008 | 545  | 167  | 70  |
| 2013 | 478  | 167  | 57  |

**Kenya: Number of health facilities**

| Year | Gov   | FBO   | NGO |
|------|-------|-------|-----|
| 2007 | 2,445 | 1,060 | 83  |
| 2012 | 4,043 | 998   | 218 |
| 2014 | 4,637 | 1,071 | 346 |


## Regions

![](img/regions.png){fig-align="center"}


## Non-governmental Organizations

**What are NGOs?**

- Private, non-profit organizations that aim to improve societal well-being through service delivery
- Provide free services, strengthen existing social infrastructure
- International, local
- Receive most of their funding from foreign aid contracts [@fafchamps2009; @brass2012]
- Generally seen as apolitical [@grebe2016]
- Marie Stopes Uganda: Provided 75% of the Intrauterine Devices distributed in Uganda between 2006 and 2011
- Maximize on impact [@dang2017]

## Non-governmental Organizations

**Who do NGOs serve?**

- Target needy communities
- Target convenient communities
- "Pragmatic saints" [@brass2012]

## Citizen Attitudes on NGOs

- Kenya: 70% of respondents said that NGOs "have the interests of the people in mind" but 34% said the same for government [@brass2016].
- Tanzanian: 81% report that NGOs have "benefited" their community [@jivani2010].
- Malawi: 60% agree that "Development NGOs provide services than cannot be provided by any other agency"; 68% consider NGOs to be effective [@jamali2014].
- Liberia: 23% of respondents trust government but 72% trust NGOs; 72% describe government as corrupt, but 19% describe NGOs as corrupt (Tsai, 2017).

## NGOs & Politics

**How might NGO service delivery impact politics?**

**NGO service delivery may weaken the 'Fiscal Link'**

- Reduce reliance of government on taxation
- Reduce reliance on citizens on PSD
- Weaken the link between government performance and citizen welfare

**NGO service delivery may undermine accountability**

- Politicians get credit for NGO PSD (increase satisfaction)
- NGOs make people more apolitical about government PSD (decrease incentives to monitor)

## NGOs & Politics

**NGOs as complements to the state** [@brass2014]

- Joint implementation / co-production
  - Learning
  - Resource sharing
- Participation in government decision making
  - Lobbying for policy-changes
  - Transmitting information on citizen preferences
- Integration of NGOs into government plans
  - Budgeting


## NGOs & Politics

**NGOs as complements to the state** [@brass2014]

- NGOs don't let governments "off the hook"
- Co-production builds state capacity
- NGOs encourage a spirit of democratic accountability

**Necessary conditions**

- Open political climate
- Autonomous agencies
- Motivated civil servants


## The Limitations of NGOs

# Bold et al. (2018)

## The Limitations of NGOs

**What is the reform?**
- Hiring contract teachers
- 

**Random assignment of:**

- Government vs NGO implementation
- Structure of contract
  + Local vs central control of hiring/firing
  + Role of school management committees
  + Salary

**Outcome?**
- Student test scores

- **Why should it work?**
  1. Smaller class sizes
  2. SMC can fire low-quality teachers
  3. Contract teachers don't have tenure

## Context

**Contract teachers**

- Lower cost
- Similar qualifications
- Different profile
  + Selection (firing)
  + Incentives (pay and retention)

## Research Design

![](img/bold_design.png){fig-align="center"}

## Research Design

![](img/bold_timeline.png){fig-align="center"}


## Findings

- NGO implementation increased test scores
- Government implementation had no effect

**Why?**
- Teacher effort: No
- Government monitoring: No
- Bureaucratic delays in payment: Yes (â…“ of effect)
- Political economy factors: Yes (union identification)

**What does this tell us about the limitations of NGOs?**


# Review of Data Assignment 1

## Additive Scale

**What is an additive scale?**

- Simple sum across columns (index = column_1 + column_2)

**Takeaways**

- When variables are measured on a common scale
- When you are interested in a cumulative amount of something
- *Not good for likert scales*
- How to deal with NAs
