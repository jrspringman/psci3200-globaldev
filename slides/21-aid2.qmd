# Cruz (2016)

## Foreign Aid and Accountability

\

**Standard channels for political manipulation**

:::{.fragment}
- Distribution of aid: Divert resources from needy to strategically valuable communities (clientelism)
- Reallocation of budgets: Divert resources from development (fungibility)
:::

## Foreign Aid and Accountability

\

**Donor strategies to avoid manipulation:**

:::{.fragment}
- Project aid
- Channel through NGOs or direct transfers
- Generally cut government actors out of the process
:::

## Three Questions

**Three questions**

1. Do citizens perceive foreign aid projects?
2. How do politicians claim credit?
3. Under what conditions are they successful?

**Sources of updating**

- Credit for welfare improvement
- More likely to secure future projects

## Research Design

\

:::{.incremental}
- Research question: Can local politicians claim undue credit for the aid projects to boost their re-election prospects
- Allocation of projects: Eligibility determined by poverty threshold 
- Least likely design for credit misattribution:
  + Low chance for political influence on distribution 
  + Minimal ability to reallocate budget in response
:::

## Undeserved Credit Claiming

:::{.incremental}
- What is undeserved credit claiming?
  + Politicians claiming credit for projects they had no role in securing
- Mechanism: 
  + Exploiting the lack of transparency and information among voters
- Implications:
  + Undermines incentives to improve welfare
:::

## Findings

- Election impact: 12% increase in re-election chances
- Increased visits: Politicians visited project sites more frequently to appear involved
- Political credit: Mayors are credited for funding or initiating projects even when respondents knew of other funding sources

## Policy Implications    

\

- Designing Aid Projects: Importance of transparency and community involvement to minimize undeserved credit claiming
- Voter Education: Enhancing voters' understanding of aid processes to better hold politicians accountable
- Involvement: Giving opportunities to contribute makes credit deserved

   
# Brief History of Non-State Service Provision


## Service Delivery & The State

**What do states do?** (Hoffman, 2015)

- Monopolize violence
- Levy taxes
- Obtain the assent of the population

**Why is public service delivery (PSD) important?**

- Promotes economic growth
- Improves welfare of citizens

## The Social Contract

**Mutual reliance between states and citizens**

- States need tax revenue
- Citizens need public services
  - Provision of clean water accounts for 60% of the increase in life expectancy in the United States between 1850 and 1950 [@troesken2001].

## The Social Contract

**Virtuous cycle between taxation, PSD, and state capacity**

- Taxation $\Rightarrow$ citizen demand for PSD
- Government PSD $\Rightarrow$ citizen compliance with taxation
- Citizen compliance with taxation $\Rightarrow$ increased state capacity
- Citizen reliance on PSD $\Rightarrow$ political accountability [@hoffman2005]


## The Fiscal Exchange

**How does this work in social contexts without direct taxation?**

- Compliance obtains when people expect that services will be delivered
- Compliance is *conditional*

**Norm-driven social contract emergence**

- Tax morale and civic duty
- Compliance is *internalized*


## Historical Service Delivery in Africa

**Service delivery in the pre-colonial period**

- Pre-colonial African states did not engage in extensive service delivery [@herbst2000]
  - States weren't geographically bounded
- Christian missions were (kinda) the first service providers
  - Emphasis on literacy and formalizing indigenous languages
  - Competing with traditional healers [@chirwa2016]

## Historical Service Delivery in Africa

**Colonial approaches to service delivery**

- Traditional medicine was outlawed [@chirwa2016]
- The church is "cemented" as the primary service provider [@jennings2014]
  - **Tanzania at the end of the colonial period**
  - Church operated 81% of primary health facilities
  - Church-operated schools outnumbered government schools 4-to-1

## Historical Service Delivery in Africa

**Post-colonial period**

- Post-colonial African states nationalized service delivery infrastructure and increased spending [@bates2014]
  - **Kenya's Civil Services** [@young1994]
  - 1945: 14,000; 1955: 45,000; 1978: 170,000
- Commodity boom $\Rightarrow$ commodity bust
- Structural adjustment: **Kenya's Health Spending** [@brass2014]
  - 1980: $9.8 million; 1993: 6.2 million; 1996: 3.6 million

## The Re-Entry of Non-State Providers

\

*In 2007, 9% and 16% of US economic engagement with developing countries has been Official Development Assistance and private philanthropy respectively* [@kapur2010].

## The Re-Entry of Non-State Providers

![](img/ingo.png){fig-align="center"}

## The Re-Entry of Non-State Providers

**Faith Based Organizations (FBOs)** [@green2002]

- Church "umbrella" organizations (ex. Uganda Protestant Medical Bureau)
  - Less aid [@reinikka2010], more user-fees [@munthali2015]
  - Cost-sharing with government
  - Uganda: 45% of the hospital beds; â…“ of the country's health workers [@tumwesigye2013]
- International religious FBOs (ex. World Vision)
  - Operate more like secular NGOs

## The Re-Entry of Non-State Providers

**Malawi: Number of health facilities**

| Year | Gov  | FBO  | NGO |
|------|------|------|-----|
| 2005 | 426  | 160  | 32  |
| 2008 | 545  | 167  | 70  |
| 2013 | 478  | 167  | 57  |

## The Re-Entry of Non-State Providers

**Kenya: Number of health facilities**

| Year | Gov   | FBO   | NGO |
|------|-------|-------|-----|
| 2007 | 2,445 | 1,060 | 83  |
| 2012 | 4,043 | 998   | 218 |
| 2014 | 4,637 | 1,071 | 346 |


## Regions

![](img/regions.png){fig-align="center"}


## Non-governmental Organizations

**What are NGOs?**

- Private, non-profit organizations that aim to improve societal well-being through service delivery
- Provide free services, strengthen existing social infrastructure
- Receive most of their funding from foreign aid contracts [@fafchamps2009; @brass2012]
- Marie Stopes Uganda: Provided 75% of the Intrauterine Devices distributed in Uganda between 2006 and 2011

## Non-governmental Organizations

**Who do NGOs serve?**

- Target needy communities
- Target convenient communities
- "Pragmatic saints" [@brass2012]

## Citizen Attitudes on NGOs

- Kenya: 70% of respondents said NGOs "have the interests of the people in mind" (34% for government) [@brass2016].
- Tanzanian: 81% report that NGOs have "benefited" their community [@jivani2010].
- Malawi: 60% agree that "Development NGOs provide services than cannot be provided by any other agency"; 68% consider NGOs to be effective [@jamali2014].
- Liberia: 23% of respondents trust government but 72% trust NGOs; 72% describe government as corrupt, but 19% describe NGOs as corrupt (Tsai, 2017).

## NGOs & Politics

**NGO service delivery may weaken the 'Fiscal Link'**

- Reduce reliance of government on taxation
- Reduce reliance on citizens on PSD
- Weaken the link between government performance and citizen welfare

**NGO service delivery may undermine accountability**

- Politicians get credit for NGO PSD
- NGOs make people more apolitical about government PSD

## NGOs & Politics

**NGOs as complements to the state** [@brass2014]

- Joint implementation / co-production
  - Learning
  - Resource sharing
- Participation in government decision making
  - Lobbying for policy-changes
  - Transmitting information on citizen preferences
- Integration of NGOs into government plans

# Bold et al. (2018)

## Scaling Up Education Reforms

**Hiring contract teachers to improve text scores**

1. Smaller class sizes
2. Higher motivation

**Scaling up**

- RCT pilot simultaneous with government scale-up

## Context

**Contract teachers**

- Lower cost
- Similar qualifications
- Different profile
  + Selection (firing)
  + Incentives (pay and retention)

## Research Design

## Scaling Up Education Reforms

**Random assignment of:**

- Government vs NGO implementation
- Structure of contract
  + Local vs central control of hiring/firing
  + Role of school management committees
  + Salary

## Findings

- NGO implementation increased test scores
- Government implementation had no effect
  + Teacher effort: No

**What does this tell us about the limitations of NGOs?**


# Review of Data Assignment 1

## Additive Scale

**What is an additive scale?**

- Simple sum across columns (index = column_1 + column_2)

**Takeaways**

- When variables are measured on a common scale
- When components contribute equally
- When you are interested in a cumulative amount of something
- *Not good for likert scales*
- How to deal with NAs
