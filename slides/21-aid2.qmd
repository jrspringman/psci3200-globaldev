2. Bold et al. (2018)
3. Final Questions: Data Assignment 1


# Cruz (2016)

## Foreign Aid and Accountability

\

**Standard channels for political manipulation**

:::{.fragment}
- Distribution of aid: Divert resources from needy to strategically valuable communities (clientelism)
- Reallocation of budgets: Divert resources from development (fungibility)
:::

## Foreign Aid and Accountability

\

**Donor strategies to avoid manipulation:**

:::{.fragment}
- Project aid
- Channel through NGOs or direct transfers
- Generally cut government actors out of the process
:::

## Three Questions

**Three questions**

1. Do citizens perceive foreign aid projects?
2. How do politicians claim credit?
3. Under what conditions are they successful?

**Sources of updating**

- Credit for welfare improvement
- More likely to secure future projects

## Research Design

\

:::{.incremental}
- Research question: Can local politicians claim undue credit for the aid projects to boost their re-election prospects
- Allocation of projects: Eligibility determined by poverty threshold 
- Least likely design for credit misattribution:
  + Low chance for political influence on distribution 
  + Minimal ability to reallocate budget in response
:::

## Undeserved Credit Claiming

:::{.incremental}
- What is undeserved credit claiming?
  + Politicians claiming credit for projects they had no role in securing
- Mechanism: 
  + Exploiting the lack of transparency and information among voters
- Implications:
  + Undermines incentives to improve welfare
:::

## Findings

- Election impact: 12% increase in re-election chances
- Increased visits: Politicians visited project sites more frequently to appear involved
- Political credit: Mayors are credited for funding or initiating projects even when respondents knew of other funding sources

## Policy Implications    

\

- Designing Aid Projects: Importance of transparency and community involvement to minimize undeserved credit claiming
- Voter Education: Enhancing voters' understanding of aid processes to better hold politicians accountable
- Involvement: Giving opportunities to contribute makes credit deserved

   
# Brief History of Non-State Service Provision


## Service Delivery & The State

**What do states do?** (Hoffman, 2015)

- Monopolize violence
- Levy taxes
- Obtain the assent of the population

**Why is public service delivery (PSD) important?**

- Promotes economic growth
- Improves welfare of citizens

## The Social Contract

**Mutual reliance between states and citizens**

- States need tax revenue
- Citizens need public services
  - Provision of clean water accounts for 60% of the increase in life expectancy in the United States between 1850 and 1950 [@troesken2001].

## The Social Contract

**Virtuous cycle between taxation, PSD, and state capacity**

- Taxation $\Rightarrow$ citizen demand for PSD
- Government PSD $\Rightarrow$ citizen compliance with taxation
- Citizen compliance with taxation $\Rightarrow$ increased state capacity
- Citizen reliance on PSD $\Rightarrow$ political accountability [@hoffman2005]


## The Fiscal Exchange

**How does this work in social contexts without direct taxation?**

- Compliance obtains when people expect that services will be delivered
- Compliance is *conditional*

**Norm-driven social contract emergence**

- Tax morale and civic duty
- Compliance is *internalized*


## Historical Service Delivery in Africa

**Service delivery in the pre-colonial period**

- Pre-colonial African states did not engage in extensive service delivery [@herbst2000]
  - States weren't geographically bounded
- Christian missions were (kinda) the first service providers
  - Emphasis on literacy and formalizing indigenous languages
  - Competing with traditional healers [@chirwa2016]

## Historical Service Delivery in Africa

**Colonial approaches to service delivery**

- Traditional medicine was outlawed [@chirwa2016]
- The church is "cemented" as the primary service provider [@jennings2014]
  - **Tanzania at the end of the colonial period**
  - Church operated 81% of primary health facilities
  - Church-operated schools outnumbered government schools 4-to-1

## Historical Service Delivery in Africa

**Post-colonial period**

- Post-colonial African states nationalized service delivery infrastructure and increased spending [@bates2014]
  - **Kenya's Civil Services** [@young1994]
  - 1945: 14,000; 1955: 45,000; 1978: 170,000
- Commodity boom $\Rightarrow$ commodity bust
- Structural adjustment: **Kenya's Health Spending** [@brass2014]
  - 1980: $9.8 million; 1993: 6.2 million; 1996: 3.6 million

## The Re-Entry of Non-State Providers

\

*In 2007, 9% and 16% of US economic engagement with developing countries has been Official Development Assistance and private philanthropy respectively* [@kapur2010].

## The Re-Entry of Non-State Providers

![](img/ingo.png){fig-align="center"}

## The Re-Entry of Non-State Providers

**Faith Based Organizations (FBOs)** [@green2002]

- Church "umbrella" organizations (ex. Uganda Protestant Medical Bureau)
  - Less aid [@reinikka2010], more user-fees [@munthali2015]
  - Cost-sharing with government
  - Uganda: 45% of the hospital beds; â…“ of the country's health workers [@tumwesigye2013]
- International religious FBOs (ex. World Vision)
  - Operate more like secular NGOs

## The Re-Entry of Non-State Providers

**Malawi: Number of health facilities**

| Year | Gov  | FBO  | NGO |
|------|------|------|-----|
| 2005 | 426  | 160  | 32  |
| 2008 | 545  | 167  | 70  |
| 2013 | 478  | 167  | 57  |

## The Re-Entry of Non-State Providers

**Kenya: Number of health facilities**

| Year | Gov   | FBO   | NGO |
|------|-------|-------|-----|
| 2007 | 2,445 | 1,060 | 83  |
| 2012 | 4,043 | 998   | 218 |
| 2014 | 4,637 | 1,071 | 346 |


## Regions

![](img/regions.png){fig-align="center"}


## Non-governmental Organizations

**What are NGOs?**

- Private, non-profit organizations that aim to improve societal well-being through service delivery
- Provide free services, strengthen existing social infrastructure
- Receive most of their funding from foreign aid contracts [@fafchamps2009; @brass2012]
- Marie Stopes Uganda: Provided 75% of the Intrauterine Devices distributed in Uganda between 2006 and 2011

## Non-governmental Organizations

**Who do NGOs serve?**

- Target needy communities
- Target convenient communities
- "Pragmatic saints" [@brass2012]

## Citizen Attitudes on NGOs

- Kenya: 70% of respondents said NGOs "have the interests of the people in mind" (34% for government) [@brass2016].
- Tanzanian: 81% report that NGOs have "benefited" their community [@jivani2010].
- Malawi: 60% agree that "Development NGOs provide services than cannot be provided by any other agency"; 68% consider NGOs to be effective [@jamali2014].
- Liberia: 23% of respondents trust government but 72% trust NGOs; 72% describe government as corrupt, but 19% describe NGOs as corrupt (Tsai, 2017).

## NGOs & Politics

**NGO service delivery may weaken the 'Fiscal Link'**

- Reduce reliance of government on taxation
- Reduce reliance on citizens on PSD
- Weaken the link between government performance and citizen welfare

**NGO service delivery may undermine accountability**

- Politicians get credit for NGO PSD
- NGOs make people more apolitical about government PSD

## NGOs & Politics

**NGOs as complements to the state** [@brass2014]

- Joint implementation / co-production
  - Learning
  - Resource sharing
- Participation in government decision making
  - Lobbying for policy-changes
  - Transmitting information on citizen preferences
- Integration of NGOs into government plans

# U.S. Foreign Aid: An Obituary

## Arenas 

1. Health
2. Democracy and governance
3. Soft Power

## Health

- HIV: 20.6 million people (600k children) no longer receiving treatment
- Tuberculosis: 10.6 million cases and 2.2 million deaths will not be prevented 
- Nutrition: HKI has stopped a program that provides nutrition for 5.6 million children
- Nutrition: In Sudan, ~80% of emergency food kitchens are closed
- Nutrition: In Ethiopia, foods to treat ~1 million severely malnourished children will run out by May
<!-- severe acute malnutrition: cut off treatment for 2.3 million children in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This would lead to 369,000 extra child deaths a year that would otherwise have been prevented. -->
<!-- The World Bank estimates that every $1 invested in tackling undernutrition returns $23 in value in terms of child survival, human capital development and economic prosperity -->
 
## Health


![](img/vox_hiv.png){fig-align="center"}

## Health  (Gibson et al., 2025)

[The impact of aid sanctions on maternal and child mortality, 1990â€“2019](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(25)00058-0/fulltext)

![](img/gibson_sanction1.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Health  (Gibson et al., 2025)

**Sample**

- 67 LMICs targeted by 88 unique aid sanction events (median duration: 5 years)
- 66 LMICs never sanctioned
- Infant, under-5, and maternal mortality declined 2.6%, 3.2%, 2%

## Health  (Gibson et al., 2025)

**Research Design**

- Difference-in-differences
- Country and year fixed effects, country-specific time trends, and multiple control variables
- Sensitivity analyses, entropy balancing

## Health  (Gibson et al., 2025)

![](img/gibson_sanction2.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Health  (Gibson et al., 2025)

![](img/gibson_sanction3.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Health  (Gibson et al., 2025)

**Findings**

- Aid sanctions reduced ODA by \$213m per year; DAH by \$16.42m
- Sanctions negate 30% of overall improvements in infant and under-5 mortality
- Increased infant, under-5, and maternal mortality by 3.1%, 3.6%, 6.4%
- 129.3 infant deaths, 47.1 under-5 deaths, 10.9 maternal deaths per 100k births

## Democracy and governance

**Does Democracy promotion work?**

- Non-trivial amount of democracy aid sounds stupid (workshops, capacity building, cultural programs)
- Recipient country behavior suggests that enough of it does work... 

## Democracy and governance

![](img/fig_2_democracy aid.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

## Democracy and governance

![](img/law_map.png){fig-align="center"}

## Democracy and governance

**Does Democracy promotion work?**

- U.S. aid withdrawal is already having a massive chilling effect on domestic civil society
- U.S. has provided an umbrella of protection for NGOs (esp partners) in repressive countries

## Democracy and governance

**Serbia: U.S. has restrained Vucic from attacking NGOs**

- 2020: [Probe of NGO finances](https://apnews.com/general-news-7733ba98001cc18cd26cc78fc83615a8)
  + Investigation into anti-corruption and advocacy NGOs
  + Accusations of money laundering and terrorist financing
  + Public and private criticism by U.S. embassy and diplomats
- 2025: [Decimation of NGOs](https://apnews.com/article/serbia-usaid-prosecutors-civil-society-probe-02af3400071175e0c4b717fb6b273493)
  + Feb 2: Musk calls USAID a criminal organization
  + Feb 25: Raids, corruption charges, and exile


## Democracy and governance

- [Carnegie and Marinov (2017)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ajps.12289) use random variation in aid to show positive effect on democracy
- [Wright (2009)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ajps.12289) uses panel data to show conditionality increases democracy
- [Finn and Tarp (2016)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030438781500111X) us dynamic panel estimators to show that governance aid increases democracy
- Democracy aid works, but we don't necessarily know how/why; effect is small and ephemeral 
    

## Soft Power

**Does aid win hearts and minds (soft power)?

- Aid improves health and education outcomes
- Recipients seem to know who gives aid
- Aid often comes with conditionality and corruption
- [Andrabi and Das (2017)](https://direct.mit.edu/rest/article/99/3/371/58451/In-Aid-We-Trust-Hearts-and-Minds-and-the-Pakistan) use spatial data to show that disaster relief in Pakistan improved trust in US and Europe
