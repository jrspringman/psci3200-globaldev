# Garcia-Ponce and Wantchekon


## Why countries Democratize

- Correlation between income and democracy
  + Modernization theory: wealth, education, and urbanization are associated with democratization
- Why might this be true?


::: {.fragment}
*In Africa, democratization after the Cold War was shaped by the level of development (urbanization) at the start of countries' anti-colonial movements*
:::

## Context

\

- Anti-colonial movements chose between two strategies:
  + Rural insurgency
  + Urban protest
- Democratization was delayed by the Cold War

::: {.fragment}
1. *What shaped opposition movements' choice between strategies?*
2. *What delayed democratization during the Cold War?*
:::

## Theory


**Why does opposition strategy affect democratization decades later?**

::: {.fragment}

- Inclusion
- Organization

:::

::: {.fragment}

**Mechanisms:**

- Institutions
- Behaviors

## Findings

## Threats to inference

- Things that affect whether or not opposition uses insurgency vs protest might also affect current levels of democracy

```


## Identification

- Covariates
- Sensitivity analysis
- Difference-in-Differences
  + Leverages changes within countries over time
  + Before the end of the cold war, groups look similar
  + After the end of the cold war, groups trend away from each other
- Instrumental Variables
  + Leverages 'plausibly exogeneous' variation in terrain 
  + Terrain predicts strategy choice

## Instrumental Variable

library(ggplot2)

## Mechanisms: Institutions

**We do not seen an impact of Post-WWII Opposition Strategy on Post-1990 Institutions**

![](img/want_institutions.png){fig-align="center"}

## Mechanisms: Behavior

![](img/want_behavior1.png){fig-align="center"}

![](img/want_behavior2.png){fig-align="center"}


## Policy Implications

\

- Historical social movements help understand the link between structural conditions and democratic development
- Non-violent collective action appears critical for the establishment of lasting democracy


# Hassan et al. (2022)

## Political Control

![](img/hassan1.png){fig-align="center"}

\

**Strategies of Control**

- Violence
- Indoctrination
- Coercive distribution
- Infiltration

# Lebas and Young (2023)

## Repression and Backlash

\

**Moments of uncertainty about political opportunity**

- Citizens uncertain about relative strength of regime and opposition
  + Risk of repression (cost)
  + Size of protests (benefit)

## Research Questions

\

- How are are individual decisions about protest affected by dissent and repression of others
- What are the mechanisms?
  + Information on costs and benefits
  + Affective polarization
  + Emotions

## Context

**Political moment**

- Ruling party leadership transition
- Contentious election
- Economic crisis

**Treatment**

- Exposure to local dissent
- Exposure to local repression

## Measurement

![](img/lebas1.png){fig-align="center"}

## Design

- Difference-in-difference estimator can partials out time-invariant differences across participants
- Assumes units are on similar trajectories prior to the treatment
- Bias could be introduced if individual shocks co-occur with treatment

## Difference-in-Differences

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show code"

Year = c(0,1,2,3)
Outcome = c(NA, 1.3, 1.5, 1.7,
            1, 1.2, 1.4,1.6,
            1.1, 1.3, 1.7, 1.9)
Treatment = c("Comparison","Comparison","Comparison","Comparison",
              "Control", "Control","Control","Control",
              "Treatment", "Treatment", "Treatment", "Treatment")

dat = data.frame(Year, Outcome, Treatment)
dat$Treatment = factor(dat$Treatment, levels = c("Treatment", "Comparison", "Control"))

ggplot(data = dat, aes(x = Year, y = Outcome,  color = Treatment)) +
  geom_line(aes(linetype=Treatment),size=2) +
  geom_point(size = 6) +
  ylim(0.8, 2.2) +
  scale_linetype_manual(values=c("solid", "dotted", "solid")) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue", "black", "red"  ) ) +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.8, 0.2), text = element_text(size=20),
        legend.title=element_blank())

```


## Findings

![](img/lebas2.png){fig-align="center"}

## Findings

- Exposure to dissent and repression increases willingness of non-supporters to protest
- Different mechanisms drive diffusion and backlash
  + Observing dissent affects beliefs about dissent (but not perceptions of risk)
  + Observing repression affects emotions (but also risk)
- Local events drive diffusion and backlash; media events do not

# Final Project Essentials

## Interaction Terms

**What is an interaction term?**

- Simple linear models assume that the effect of predictors is independent of other factors 
- Interaction terms allow us to estimate the difference in the slope of a predictor across unit characteristics

**What are they used for?**

- Heterogeneous effects
- Difference-in-differences

## Interaction Terms


**How do they do work?**

$$
Y_i = \alpha + \beta_1 X_{i1} + \beta_2 X_{i2} + \beta_3 (X_{i1}*X_{i2}) + \epsilon_i
$$


**Example:** Continuous outcome with two binary predictors

- $\alpha$: Intercept when $X_{i1}$ and $X_{i2}$ are 0
- $\beta_1$ Slope when $X_{i2} = 0$
- $\beta_2$ Difference in $\alpha$ between $X_{i2}=0$ and $X_{i2}=1$
- $\beta_3$ Difference in $\beta_1$ between $X_{i2}=0$ and $X_{i2}=1$
