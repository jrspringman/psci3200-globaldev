## What are R and RStudio?

- R is a programming language and free computing environment for statistical computing and graphics
- RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that provides an interface by adding many convenient features and tools
- Think of R as a car's engine and RStudio as the dashboard
- RStudio can also be used to manage projects, produce documents, build websites

:::{.notes}
R is a programming language and free computing environment for statistical computing and graphics. It can be runs on a wide variety of operating systems, including Linux, Windows, and MacOS. RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that provides an interface by adding many convenient features and tools.

You can think of R as a car's engine and RStudio as the dashboard. In the same way that having access to a speedometer and a navigation system makes driving much easier, using RStudio’s interface makes using R much easier as well.

R and RStudio are entirely free and updated on a regular basis, making them much more accessible and widely used than paid alternatives. You can conduct nearly any analysis using R, ranging from calculating the average of a variable to creating maps and conducting spatial analysis to conducting the analysis for an impact evaluation.

## Peronalization

- Customize the appearance of your R IDE by going to Tools -> Global Options -> Appearance

## Basic programming concepts

- Conditionals:
  + Testing for equality in R is done using `==`. For example, `2 + 1 == 3` will return `TRUE`
  + Boolean algebra: Operators such as `<` (less than), `<=` (less than or equal), and `!=`(not equal to). For example, `3 + 5 <= 1` will return `FALSE`
  + Logical operators: `&` represent “and” while `|` represents “or.” For example, `(2 + 1 == 3) & (2 + 1 == 4)` returns `FALSE` since both clauses are not `TRUE` 



- Functions
- 


## Loading Packages

- R gives you accesss to thousands of "packages" that are created by users
- Packages contain datasets and bundles of code called "functions" that can execute specific tasks
- Use `install.packages()` to install a package
  + Insert the name of the package contained in quotation marks
  + Start by installing the `dplyr` package


## Loading Data

- Load data into your environment by "reading-in" a spreadsheet
- Spreadsheets should be saved as a `.csv` file
- Use `read.csv()` to pull data from a spreadsheet on your harddrive into your R/RStudio environment
  + Within the parentheses, add the full file pathway where the `.csv` file is stored

## Errors, warnings, and messages

- When you run code, R often provides feedback in the console
- There are 3 main types of feedback that appear in RED
  + Errors: When the RED text is prefaced with “Error in…”, your code will not work. The error message will try to explain the problem.
  + Warnings: When the red text is prefaced with “Warning:”, your code will still work, but there still might be a problem. The warning message will try to explain the problem.
  + Messages: When the red text doesn’t start with “Error” or “Warning”, it’s just a friendly message
